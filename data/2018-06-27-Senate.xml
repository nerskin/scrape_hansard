                    </a>  What's happening here needs a bit of context so that the Senate and the Australian people can understand what's being done here this morning. These bills went to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, which is a closed shop—no member of the Senate crossbench, including the Australian Greens, is represented on that committee. Out of that committee process came a total of 280 amendments to these pieces of legislation that we only saw for the first time yesterday afternoon. Those amendments came out of the absolutely normal process that occurs behind the closed doors of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, and that is that the Labor Party and the coalition parties got together and hammered out a dirty deal, and the parliament, and now the Senate, are being presented with a fait accompli and being treated as a rubber-stamp by the Labor Party and the coalition parties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has said reasonably consistently, if not entirely consistently, that it wishes to have both of these bills passed through both houses of this parliament this week. What it has abjectly failed to do is mount any kind of rational argument as to why these bills should be subject to such an unholy rush. These two bills we have before us do many things, but in overview they are a draconian and deliberate attempt to stifle political debate in this country. They are a draconian and deliberate attempt to muzzle non-government organisations who are fighting to look after our environment or defend human rights or hold the government to account. They are a draconian and deliberate stitch-up between the Australian Labor Party and the coalition parties as so often happens in this space. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Greens do not accept the argument that these bills need to be put through the Senate this week. In fact, yesterday we moved to refer the provisions of this legislation, including the 280 amendments, which we only saw for the first time yesterday afternoon, off to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for an inquiry so the Australian people could have a say, which they’ve been denied to date because the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security only dealt with the bills as originally drafted. There are now 280 amendments to these two pieces of legislation that will be subjected to no other scrutiny than what the Labor and Liberal parties in collusion will grant in the Senate over the next two days. That is 280 amendments to legislation that will criminalise peaceful non-violent protest in some circumstances. It is 280 amendments, which we only saw yesterday afternoon for the first time, to legislation that will criminalise public interest journalism in some cases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's put a couple of examples before the Senate so that no-one can say they didn't know what they're about to ram through in such an unholy rush. Firstly, let's say someone decides they want to make a political point by disrupting the loading of a boat that is being loaded with live sheep for export to the Middle East—they want to blockade the road leading to that port. Suddenly, they find themselves in breach of this draconian legislation and, if charged and convicted, find themselves facing a term of imprisonment of up to 15 years. Let's take another example. A journalist decides they want to report on an egregious breach of human rights carried out by Australia. They report that egregious breach. That report comes to the attention of a foreign government and provides an advantage to the foreign government or damages Australia's relationship with that foreign government, and the journalist and the publisher, if arrested, charged and convicted, face a term of imprisonment of 25 years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's highly likely that this legislation, if passed as it is proposed to be today, would get laughed out of the High Court in damned quick time because it breaches the implied right to freedom of political communication in our country; that is the view of legal and constitutional experts who have offered their opinion publicly on this matter in recent days. I'll be putting their views more robustly on the record as we move through the remaining process to examine this legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Make no mistake: this Senate has the right, and in fact deserves the opportunity, to apply significant scrutiny to this legislation. The Senate has been denied by the Australian Labor Party and the coalition a chance to have this legislation interrogated at an inquiry of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, and now we have the government proposing to take these two highly complex, highly dangerous pieces of legislation through this Senate in one go. Again, it is a move designed to avoid the necessary scrutiny of this legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Greens are going to stand up in this place and defend our democracy. We are going to defend public interest journalism. We are going to defend civil society. We are going to defend people's rights to peaceful and non-violent protest in this country. One of the ways we are going to do these things is by holding this government to account. In order to do that in an optimal way, we need these bills separated so that we can interrogate them one after the other, not have them rammed through in an unholy rush by the Australian Labor Party, who are in zombie lock step with the coalition, as they so often are. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's worth making the point that one of the biggest fears of the Australian Labor Party is that there is thin air between Labor and the coalition on issues that they regard as national security or counterterrorism issues. Of course, the reason for that is purely political. Labor don't want to open up a crack that people like Minister Dutton and Minister Cormann can drive the wedge into. The government are champing at the bit to drive the wedge into Labor, and Labor is engaged in gutless, cowardly politics by remaining in lock step with the government on these issues. So there are political reasons behind us facing this unholy rush today, but ultimately it is the country and the Australian people who are going to be the losers, because Labor has decided to sacrifice them on the altar of political expediency. It is gutless and cowardly politics. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need the opportunity to make sure these bills are comprehensively scrutinised. They are horrendously complicated, they are entirely draconian and they are incredibly dangerous not only in their intent but in their effect. Ultimately, we are again seeing rights, freedoms and liberties in this country—which we used to send Australians overseas to defend, with the sacrifice of Australian lives—eroded before our very eyes because the Labor Party is too gutless to stand up to the coalition on issues around national security and counterterrorism. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been over 200 pieces of legislation passed through the Commonwealth and state and territory parliaments in Australia in the last 20 years that erode fundamental rights and freedoms in this country. We remain the only liberal democracy in the world that does not have a charter of rights, which would allow us to enshrine and protect basic rights and freedoms in such a way that this legislation either could not pass or, if it did pass, would be found to be unlawful or unconstitutional, or, at the very least, greater opportunities would be provided to scrutinise the draconian provisions of this legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What the Australian people are going to witness in this Senate today is the zombie lock step of the old parties to support legislation and some procedural motions that will have a chilling effect on the capacity of non-government organisations to defend our environment, on the capacity of journalists in this country to hold the government to account and report in the public interest in some circumstances, and on the capacity of civil society's essential job in any democracy—to scrutinise and hold those with the ultimate power to account. If these bills pass unamended this week, it'll be a sad, sad day for Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to the minister: the Australian Greens will avail ourselves of every opportunity here to make sure that these bills can be scrutinised and that the collusion between the ALP and the coalition is laid bare and to make sure that the impact of these laws is at least placed on the record so that nobody can say they didn't know what they were voting for at the end of this debate. Part of the way that we want to do that is to ensure that these bills can be considered separately. I say, again, there are 280 amendments, which speaks volumes about the quality and the overreach of the original legislation. We saw them yesterday afternoon for the first time. Here we are, less than 24 hours after we first saw those 280 amendments, and the government and the Labor Party are going to vote together, I suspect and I fear, to deny this Senate the opportunity to do its job, which is to scrutinise these two pieces of terrible legislation in the most effective way that is open for this chamber. So I do urge senators here to support the Greens motion, because this will allow for the bills to be considered and debated separately rather than considered and debated together, which is part of the strategy of the government—and, I believe, likely the ALP—to deny this Senate the capacity to properly do its job.</span>

Centre Alliance will be supporting this motion to deal with the bills separately. We note that it's very important national security legislation and, in principle, we are in support of it—although we don't necessarily understand all of the details. And that needs to be drawn out, as Senator McKim has suggested. This has gone to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. There has been considerable discussion both in the PJCIS and in the media in relation to these bills. It's a very complex set of legislation that involves powers to protect national security, but it also inhibits conduct of citizens. That may be necessary, but we need to explore that in much more detail. There have been two reports that the PJCIS has generated in relation to these—754 pages worth of reports—with 60 recommendations from the first report and 52 recommendations from the second report. We do need to consider this carefully and properly. As I said, Centre Alliance will be supporting the motion.</span>

What I don't appreciate is the way that it has been dumped now on the Senate in such a way that the Australian Greens are forced into making a contribution on the motion before the chair without actually having had the opportunity to understand or even read the government's reasons for the unholy rush that the Senate finds itself engaged in at the moment. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To show good faith with this chamber, Minister, you should have got up then and made the arguments on your feet so that we could understand them. But, no, here we are, getting stampeded through again, with you showing a distinct lack of courtesy to this Senate. It's not good enough to just whack a bit of paper down on the table and expect the debate to be fully informed. The debate isn't fully informed, Minister, because I haven't had a chance and none of my colleagues in the Greens or on the crossbench have had a chance to actually understand what your arguments are for insisting that these pieces of dangerous draconian legislation are rammed through the Senate this week in such an unholy rush.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thought this was a debating chamber. I thought this was one of the supreme, if not the supreme, debating chambers in the county, if not the world, of Westminster parliaments. But that's not the way the minister has just treated this chamber now. He has come in and whacked a bit of paper down on the table, and he is expecting this debate to be fully informed. I want to put on the record that we are unable to rebut the minister's arguments because the minister didn't have the courtesy to get up in the five minutes allotted to him in this process and actually make the arguments as part of the debate. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:57</span>):  Obviously, the numbers are here for this to go through anyway so I don't wish to speak purely to try and make debating points, but I do want to put things on the record. For those who are following this issue, as hopefully the Australian public or those that follow the issues that come before the parliament are aware, the legislation that is being put forward already this morning is of enormous significance to the rights of every person who resides in Australia, not just citizens but everybody else. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The matter immediately before us is the government seeking leave to move to exempt these bills from the cut-off order. It is worth emphasising why the cut-off order is in place. The cut-off order is something that goes back—if my memory serves me correctly—to the 1980s. It was originally proposed by former Queensland colleague—a predecessor of mine—Senator Michael Macklin, because of the problematic practice, which frequently occurred, of legislation being tabled and immediately debated before the chamber had a chance to properly scrutinise it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we have already heard, this issue has been scrutinised by a committee that excludes most of the parties in this Senate, except for the two largest ones. So the principle that has been in place since the 1980s—it has been reformed a bit over time, including by, I think, WA Greens senators—is that it should only be by explicit and informed decision of the Senate that we agree to exempt legislation from what is a standing order. It is a standing order that legislation should not be introduced and considered within the same week. That is for the very simple reason that it is our job to make sure that we are properly informed when we make decisions about whether or not the legislation we pass is adequate and does not have unintended consequences. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Forget about the ideological differences here and the philosophical differences about what's right and what's wrong, what needs to happen and what doesn't need to happen. We need to make sure that we don't include things in the legislation that are done by mistake. That has happened time and time again. The vast majority of times that it has happened have been in precisely this situation, when, for political reasons—and let's not kid ourselves; this rush is totally for political reasons—things are put in legislation when even the people who want them in there have not had the chance to properly scrutinise what the actual consequences of those words will be. That's bad with regard to any piece of legislation—it's the law of the land; it affects the entire community—but, when we're talking about legislation that affects people's basic liberties on such a fundamental level, then it is incumbent upon us to make sure that we properly scrutinise what it is we are doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's not forget, when we are talking about legislation, that it is not blind. There are sections of the community—Indigenous Australians, Muslim Australians and others—who are far more likely to fall foul of legislation that is bent and interpreted to meet the preconceptions, structural prejudices and racism of our legal system. We see that time and time again. The reasons for urgency that the minister tabled are only just now being distributed around the chamber. Had it not been for the decision to not just wave this through, if the Senate had done what has, unfortunately, become common practice and just waved it through and said, 'Yes, sure, exempt this legislation from the cut-off,' had it not been for the action of the Greens in denying leave and wanting this to actually be debated, we wouldn't have even known what the reasons were. Maybe Labor has already seen these reasons. I don't know. I suspect not. But the Senate itself wouldn't have even known what the reasons were for urgency. If we look at the reasons for urgency, the document is only that long. It's one paragraph plus an extra sentence. This legislation is required urgently in response to the 'unprecedented threat of espionage and foreign interference'. Gee whiz, that's really detailed reasoning! This has happened time and time again in this area, in particular. Can we finally learn from our mistakes? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The government asserts that it is urgent, and its statement of reasons—and thank you to the minister for circulating it—</span>

                    </a>  Not urgently, quite so—simply an assertion that it is urgent. There is no reason why it is urgent. It doesn't say a national emergency or something bad is going to happen if these bills are not passed. Nothing bad is going to happen if these bills are not passed. We have had elections and by-elections before. Nothing will happen that hasn't happened before if these bills are not passed. There is simply no good reason why we can't debate these when we return in August, having had the opportunity of considering the final versions of the bills, amended according to the recommendations of the PJCIS, with more than 24 hours notice. There is no explanation for why we can't have sufficient time to consider the amended bills in this statement. It's just an assertion. There is no justification for this urgency.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:04</span>):  I rise on behalf of the opposition to make a few points. The first is to recognise the reason for standing order 111, which is to ensure that the chamber has the opportunity to consider legislation. I make the point that the limb of that standing order which requires, in these circumstances, the minister to move the motion he has would not have been activated, as I understand it, if this message had in fact been received last night. It is standing order 111(5)(c). So let's understand: if the message had come over last night, then the Greens and the crossbench wouldn't be in the position of making the contributions they are making.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second point I'd make is that we do agree that the principle of consideration of legislation by the parliament is important. These are national security bills. They were introduced in December of last year. They have been through an extensive—extensive—consideration process before the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a>  I take the interjection of 'closed shop'. Yes, that is correct. It is an intelligence committee, peopled by parties of government, that receives national security briefings and considers national security legislation. We do not resile from that, and there are very sound national interest reasons for that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The next point I'd make is it is incorrect to suggest that there has not been public consideration of these bills. As a member of that committee I'm indebted to Senator McAllister, who's made sure I have in front of me the list of hearings that we engaged in on the two pieces of legislation—the espionage legislation and the interference legislation. Those hearings on those two pieces of legislation happened in January, February and March, and in January, February and June respectively. We received 51 submissions on the espionage legislation and 92 submissions on the FITS Bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do acknowledge this, and I will say this again in the second reading debate: I think there have been problems with the process relating to this legislation. With respect, I think that they were poorly handled by the former Attorney-General, as has been demonstrated by the lengthy process of consideration; the number of public submissions that have been critical of the drafting of the legislation; and the extensive amendments that have been required as a consequence of the intelligence committee's recommendation and which the government, I acknowledge, has accepted, which we think is a good thing. So those are the circumstances in which the opposition will be supporting the government in its request for urgency in relation to these bills.</span>

Whilst the legislation has been considered in great detail by that committee, the information that's flowed out from that has flowed to us only very, very recently.

Normally you have to ground a claim when you make it, and it doesn't do you any favours, Minister, in not doing so here today. I make the point also that last week in the chamber I faced a round of criticism for not allowing debate on another bill, which I would argue was much, much simpler. I had the Labor Party heckling me across the chamber. I had Senator Wong accusing me of being in bed with Senator Cormann. I think the words were, 'When Senator Cormann says jump, Senator Patrick says, "How high?"' I don't know why this doesn't translate into this particular debate.</span>

The first thing they did when they walked into the chamber was move a motion to support stage 1 and stage 2. That left me relatively confused. What I then drew from that was that there was to be an extended debate, a filibustering of the whole process, and for that reason we agreed with the government that it was just a tactic. But I don't understand exactly what is happening here. We'd like to have quite a lengthy discussion on this. We would have liked to have dealt with the bills separately. That, of course, has been denied us by an agreement by two parties that have shared the love inside the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security but not the information.</span>

Senator Patrick has indicated today that the reason he gave support to this was that he was confused by the Labor Party's position. I will tell you this: the best way to resolve confusion, if you are feeling confused in the chamber at any time, is actually to allow a debate to proceed; to allow the committee stage to proceed; to allow questions to be asked; and to allow the many parties in this chamber to provide a perspective. And that is what the committee stage allows. Unfortunately, that is not what was allowed. That is not what was allowed when the debate on corporate tax took place last week. Instead, what happened was that just 1½ hours was allowed for an extraordinarily complex process—just 1½ hours to debate a package worth $143 billion. That is an extraordinary abrogation of the Senate's responsibilities, and you ought to be ashamed for having supported it.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What then happened, even more remarkably, was that we went through, line by line, pages and pages of amendments, voting without discussion on the numbers—just colour-by-number Senate practice. That was entirely enabled by your decision to support the government's procedural motion to shut down debate on personal income tax. And, finally, the cruellest cut perhaps of all is that you voted, but when a message came back from the House of Representatives on personal income tax that we would consider without amendment or debate—abrogated the Senate's responsibility to scrutinise legislation and abrogated our opportunity to insist on the amendments we had recommended to the House of Representatives. So do not come in here and talk to us about process. The Labor Party today will facilitate debate on these bills: debate that follows a public process that commenced in December and is concluding now in June. We are completely comfortable with that, and you ought to be ashamed of the position you have taken in recent weeks.</span>

Yes, last week was bad process—have no doubt. The Greens believe that it was very bad process and our vote showed what we thought about that. However, one bad process does not justify another bad process. The fact is the crossbench was not involved in the committee that scrutinised these two bills. We've already said we don't think they should be debated together because we have serious concerns about both bills that need to be aired. They are separate bills, but bad process does not justify bad process.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is there are 280 amendments that were made in a very short time frame in the House of Reps yesterday, which we have not had time to get across. We don't know if those amendments actually reflect the findings of the committee when they made their recommendations on these bills. And what do we get to justify the cut-off order which prevents us from adequately scrutinising those 280 amendments? We get a paragraph and a sentence about urgency that just says, 'These are urgent because they are urgent,' and throws in the word 'security'. We're all supposed to throw up our hands every single time the government and the ALP mention security and go, 'Ooh! We'd better do what they want.' Well, we don't think that's right to throw around the word 'security' when the security risk has not been increased from 'probable' for five years. So what does that mean about urgency? They throw around the word 'security', but when you actually look at it there hasn't been an increase in the threat level. But we are supposed to run around and go, 'Oh, anything you want.'</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The crossbench don't think this is an appropriate process. We think it should be considered properly. We think we should be given the opportunity to properly scrutinise 280 amendments, and the community should be given a chance to properly scrutinise those amendments to see what they think. We have very serious concerns, as Senator McKim has already articulated, around what this package of bills means for our democracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have not had that opportunity yet. We don't know what those amendments mean. We have concerns about those bills, which we have articulated clearly before, and yet we were still denied the opportunity to participate in the community process because the two old parties want to keep ganging together, throwing around the terms 'urgency' and 'security', and locking out the community. That's what this does. It locks out the community and its ability to properly scrutinise these bills, and it prevents this place from properly scrutinising these bills and looking at the impact of these bills and their 280 amendments—amendments that were blinked through in the House of Representatives without proper scrutiny, and now we don't have the ability to scrutinise them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why we tried to refer these bills to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee—so that we could review what the amended bills mean and enable the community to have their say on them too. We don't support this being rushed through on the flimsy paragraph that says, 'They're urgent because we believe they're urgent, and just trust us.' Well, we don't trust you. We don't trust you on urgency and we don't trust you whenever you use the word 'scrutiny' and expect us to run round and go, 'Oh, okay, that's fine; we'll blink it through.' Well, we won't.</span>

Had the message conveying these bills from the House of Representatives been received by the Senate prior to the Senate adjournment being moved at 7.20 last night, this motion of exemption would not have been necessary. So all of the debate and the touch of histrionics we've heard is because of 14 hours—the time between 7.20 last night and 9.30 this morning. That's the only point about time that is of relevance to why this motion is necessary. Of course, I doubt that those 14 hours are the fundamental reason as to why the Greens or others are opposing this. They are opposing this motion because they want to take a stance on other matters rather than on the substance of the motion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The substance of the motion will allow proper debate of this legislation in the Senate. The Senate will go through its usual debate, as we have and as we will. Second reading debates will occur, and I see that amendments are being circulated. All of those considerations will no doubt take place over the coming hours. This debate has simply eaten into the time today that would otherwise have been available to get into that debate. I'm not going to delay the Senate any further, other than to highlight that the government has taken the action of bringing this legislation forward, as the reasons of urgency state, in response to the unprecedented threat of espionage and foreign interference. That's why we introduced the legislation, it's why we supported the full and proper examination through the PJCIS and it is why we now ask the Senate to consider this bill, as passed and amended by the House of Representatives.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Today I am pleased to introduce to the Senate the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2018, which is a comprehensive package of legislative measures to address the threat of espionage and foreign interference in Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Covert interference and espionage by nation states are global realities which have the potential to cause immense harm to our national sovereignty, to the safety of our people, our economic prosperity, and to the very integrity of our democracy. To counter this threat, Australia must have a robust legislative framework to ensure our law enforcement and national security agencies are sufficiently empowered to investigate and disrupt malicious foreign interference. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The reforms in this Bill are comprehensive. They represent the most significant counterintelligence reforms since the 1970's. The measures in this Bill will fundamentally reshape our national security offences to protect Australia's sovereignty and information, and protect the democratic principles and values that underpin our society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill is the result of a comprehensive review into Australia's espionage and foreign interference legislation, undertaken by the Attorney‑General at my request. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's criminal laws are inadequate. Without effective modern laws, and serious criminal penalties, our law enforcement and security agencies are unable to adequately investigate and disrupt this malicious conduct.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government can and must do more to deter and counter the pervasive foreign interference activities directed against Australia's interests. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Recent events overseas, including cyber operations and disinformation campaigns designed to influence the US and French elections, have brought the insidious threat of covert foreign interference into public view. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is not immune. The Director-General of Security has advised that the scale of foreign interference activities against Australia is unprecedented. Espionage and foreign interference activity against Australian interests is extensive, unrelenting and increasingly sophisticated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Unlike the routine business of diplomatic influence practised by all nation states, foreign interference is characterised by clandestine and deceptive activities undertaken by foreign actors seeking to cause significant harm to our national interests, or advance their own interests. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To ensure Australia is not a permissive operating environment for malicious foreign actors, and to protect our core interests, the Australian Government must respond by introducing stronger and more modern laws, that are fit for the purpose of countering the threat of foreign interference. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill that I introduce today contains a series of measures designed to do just that. The National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2018 will strengthen criminal offences targeting espionage, official secrets, sabotage, treason and other offences against the government. And, it will introduce, for the first time, new offences targeting foreign interference and economic espionage by foreign actors.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will include comprehensive new espionage offences that are designed to capture the full range of conduct undertaken to compromise sensitive information and prejudice our national security. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Operational experience has demonstrated that Australia's existing espionage offences are extremely difficult to prosecute. But what is more concerning is that they are too narrow to adequately defend the full scope of Australia's interests. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Foreign actors want access to all types of information and they are using a range of techniques to get it. Today, the communication of unclassified or publicly available information can be equally as damaging to Australia's national security interests as classified information. This is particularly so when it is done with the intention of prejudicing Australia's national security or advantaging the national security of another country. As with many security threats, rapid technological change has continued to provide people who are engaging in espionage with the tools to conceal their activities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The new espionage offences in the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2018 will apply to all information, and not just information that is security classified or that relates to Australia's security or defence. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The offences will also criminalise a broader spectrum of harmful conduct. This includes traditional espionage activities, as well as a person who is soliciting or procuring espionage, or a person preparing for espionage. This will capture the breadth of conduct that is being undertaken to facilitate espionage activities against Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, the Bill will introduce offences that not only target the person who discloses the information, but also the actions of the foreign spy who receives the information. This will mean that foreign spies who task others to undertake espionage activities against Australian interests can be charged and prosecuted under Australian law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will also introduce a new offence criminalising economic espionage, or the theft of trade secrets for a foreign actor. This offence will combat the increasing threat of data theft, business interruption and economic espionage undertaken at the direction of foreign governments. </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's foreign adversaries do not solely rely on espionage to further their interests. Foreign powers are covertly seeking to shape the opinions of members of the Australian public, media organisations and government officials in order to advance their country's own political objectives. Ethnic, religious and expatriate communities in Australia are also the subject of covert interference operations designed to suppress their criticism of foreign governments. In some instances these activities involve threats of harm or intimidation, which is a clear violation of the rights and freedoms we should all enjoy in this country.</span>

Today's debate on these bills occurs some six months after they were first introduced into the parliament. At the time, the Prime Minister made an assurance to the House that these bills were both straightforward and carefully structured. Regrettably, that was not so. In fact, the bills we are now debating take into consideration no fewer than 60 changes recommended by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. I say that these bills are immeasurably improved by those changes, which have the support of both opposition and government members. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to pay tribute to my fellow members of the parliamentary joint committee, in particular the shadow Attorney-General, Mr Dreyfus; the deputy chair, Anthony Byrne; and my colleagues Senator McAllister and Dr Kelly. I also acknowledge the work of the chair, Mr Hastie, and members of the coalition. A lot of hard work has taken place over the past six months to bring these bills up to the standard which is expected by the Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party has consistently supported the principles and the objectives of the legislation that the chamber is debating. However, we had deep concerns about the way in which they were originally drafted. There is no greater obligation on all members and senators than to ensure the safety and security of the Australian people. Labor's record of constructive engagement on all national security bills brought before the parliament backs this up. We also recognise that threats facing the nation are constantly evolving and can change rapidly, and national security laws must, therefore, be constantly reviewed. Laws developed in the age of letters and telegrams are clearly not fit for purpose in the age of social media.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The key threats that these two bills seek to address are those of covert foreign interference and covert foreign influence in our democratic processes. As one of only a handful of nations that has been a democracy for the entirety of the past and current centuries, we have a proud tradition of open and vigorous public debate in all areas of the Australian political process. But, as we have increasingly seen in recent years, there are those who are willing to seek to abuse the trust that we and other nations place in our democratic processes and to use the freedoms that are denied in other nations and seek to exert and engage in covert influence or interference.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The question here, and the balancing act, is and has always been: how to respond to this threat while retaining our great traditions of free speech and participatory democracy. I don't think anyone—or few, if any—would now argue that the laws introduced by the Prime Minister last year got this balance right. This isn't simply a partisan position; this was the view of churches, charities, journalists, lawyers and members of the business community, and, it appears, a number of members of the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Without the changes proposed by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, now agreed to by both government and opposition, these bills would have left journalists potentially liable for severe criminal penalties merely for reporting on national security matters that a government considered embarrassing. Unamended, these laws would have imposed enormous administrative burdens on charities across our country, backed up by criminal sanctions for noncompliance. Unamended, these laws could have seen members of the Catholic clergy forced to register by virtue of the church's leadership being based in the Vatican. Unamended, these laws could well have seen Australian academics being forced to register as foreign agents simply for collaborating on a project with an overseas institution or academic partner. Frankly, these would have been absurd outcomes and were completely unacceptable to most Australians. It is deeply concerning that the processes inside Mr Turnbull's government did not lead the Prime Minister, the then Attorney-General or other members of the cabinet to recognise this prior to these laws being introduced, or, if they did recognise them, proceeding with them, regardless.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The parliamentary joint committee has done an enormous amount of work in order to amend these bills and bring them up to the standard that the Australian people would expect and demand. Indeed, in the last few days we have seen statements from media organisations, charities, churches and others congratulating the committee and the parliament on the improvements we have made. Not everyone is happy, and many would argue that further changes need to be made. There are some on the other side—I noted a column by Mr Sheridan—who observe that the balance has gone too far the other way with regard to charities. I think it is clear from the public commentary and from the content of the bills before the chamber that the bills are vastly improved from the ones that were originally brought into the House. I do make this point: the government really ought learn from the extent of the redrafting and amendments which were required to be processed through the parliamentary joint committee. The parliament ought not have to deal with bills that are so far from the standard that is expected by the Australian people through a committee process. They ought have been presented to the parliament in a much more reasonable and considered form.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn now to the specific provisions of the bill. I am indebted to my colleague in the other place the shadow Attorney-General, Mr Dreyfus, for both his contributions to the bills and his analysis of them, much of which I now turn to. The National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2017 reforms the Commonwealth's espionage, sabotage, treason, treachery and secrecy laws in the Commonwealth Criminal Code and in the Crimes Act 1914. It introduces offences of foreign interference which criminalise the activities of foreign actors who are seeking to interfere with Australia's democratic and political processes. There are some 38 offences in this bill. Most are expanded or reformed offences that have existed in one form or another in Australia's criminal law since 1914, and there are seven new offences of foreign interference.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Because criminal sanctions are such a serious matter, criminal law reform does need to be carefully thought through and subjected to public scrutiny and comment. We are disappointed on this side that, in a break from the usual practice, the former Attorney-General did not publish an exposure draft of the bill or consult with experts prior to it being brought into the House. Some of the procedural and substantive concerns I alluded to earlier might well have been avoided if he had gone through that process. Had this occurred, Labor believe that many of the problems that were later identified by the parliamentary joint committee could have been avoided from the start.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This failure was compounded by the short deadlines which were set for submissions from interested citizens, civil society and other experts. The submissions that were received quickly made clear that Labor were not alone in our concerns about the bill as it was then drafted. There were a number of drafting errors—what we regard as significant overreach and inadequate safeguards. I acknowledge that the new Attorney-General, Mr Porter, responded to these initial concerns by presenting, in the form of a submission to the parliamentary joint committee inquiry, a set of amendments designed to resolve some of the errors or concerns that had been identified in the secrecy offences contained in schedule 2 of the bill. These include the items identified by media organisations, who had suggested to the committee that the bill as presented could make it a serious criminal offence for journalists and staff of organisations to innocently receive secretive information, whether or not that information was classified.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were other concerns expressed in relation to these bills by the Law Council of Australia and the Human Rights Law Centre. Even the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security outlined concerns that some of the offences would make it impossible for her and her staff to fulfil their statutory duties—an extraordinary proposition. There were similar concerns from the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner and the Commonwealth Ombudsman. Regrettably—and, frankly, extraordinarily—not one of these organisations or government office holders, including the Inspector-General, were consulted about the proposed laws prior to their introduction.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Following months of constructive bipartisan work, with exceptional support from the staff of the committee secretariat, whose work I acknowledge and thank them for, the committee tabled a 404-page report on 7 June which made 60 recommendations. These address many of the concerns raised by civil society and the media to substantially improve the effectiveness of the bill. These recommendations have been adopted by the government, and Labor thanks the Attorney-General, Mr Porter, for working constructively with the shadow Attorney-General to deliver these amendments, which have been necessary to make this bill workable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill now before the parliament and the amendments proposed in the two substantial amendment sheets overhaul the significant number of offences traditionally associated with criminalising malicious interference in our democratic and security apparatus by foreign countries. The bill modernises and reforms offences against government, including, as I said, treason, treachery and mutiny; assisting the escape of a prisoner of war; and military-style training involving a foreign principal. These will all continue to be part of the Criminal Code. The committee report made clear that these offences were in no way designed to capture humanitarian work in conflict zones or circumstances in which a journalist covers a conflict and presents information that might be seen as supporting a particular group that has been designated as an enemy under a proclamation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new division 91 in schedule 1 of the bill amends and modernises the existing espionage offences in division 91 of the Criminal Code. Under the new division, the number of espionage offences will increase to cover the gaps in the criminal law that our security agencies have identified as being presently exploited by foreign actors conducting espionage against Australia and in Australia against other countries. The espionage offences are premised on some element of harm or damage being caused to the Commonwealth. And whilst it might be embarrassing if some future role were uncovered and disclosed by civil society groups, mere embarrassment will not be enough to make out the elements of the offences. This requirement is coupled with the fact that a prosecution would have to prove beyond reasonable doubt that a civil society organisation or an individual whistleblower had intended to cause prejudice or was reckless as to whether prejudice would be caused to Australia's national security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also introduces a new division—division 92 of the Criminal Code. This contains several offences that are completely new to Australia's criminal law. The object of these offences is the disruption and criminalisation of covert acts of foreign interference that threaten Australia's democratic processes. When he introduced the bill, Mr Turnbull cited examples of such foreign interference: the 2016 American presidential election, the Brexit referendum in the United Kingdom and the presidential election in France. To the best of our knowledge, we have not seen that in Australia. But this bill makes clear that Australia should not, will not and cannot allow such conduct to be tolerated on our shores. This legislation, at its heart, declares that this parliament will not allow interference in our elections or in our democratic processes. We will not allow these to be subject to foreign interference and we will not allow the covert subversion of our politics by foreign interests. That objective should be an objective held across this parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also updates and modernises Australia's sabotage offences. There had been criticism that these provisions might be used to criminalise innocent and peaceful protest. I assure those many very well-meaning people who have put these concerns to us that this is not the way in which these offences are intended to operate. Nor, as is advised to us, is it the way in which a court would interpret them. They are, however, intended to criminalise sabotage—a serious attack on our country. They are not intended to criminalise peaceful protest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As an important consequence of the amendments put forward by the Attorney-General in March, the secrecy offences are now to be split between offences committed by Commonwealth officers and offences committed by non-Commonwealth officers. This is a change supported by the Labor Party. The PJCIS recommendation, which has been picked up by the government, ensures that there will be more limited circumstances applying to non-Commonwealth officers. In particular, Labor has ensured that there will be a robust and broad exemption for journalists, which will stop the laws being used to censor or suppress media reporting. There is now a prior-publication defence and a public interest defence for the secrecy offences. The amendments also make explicit that the protections and immunities for whistleblowers that already exist are not affected by this bill. In particular, I note the requirement that the offences that use the phrase 'prejudice to Australia's national security' are to be interpreted as requiring a degree of damage or harm to Australia's national security. Mere embarrassment will not be sufficient to make out this element of the offences contained in that phrase.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party has worked constructively and in good faith with the government to make sure that this bill has been significantly improved, and we thank the government for joining with us in adopting all the recommendations of the joint committee. It now properly targets the conduct which the parliament is seeking to criminalise whilst safeguarding those fundamental and essential rights and freedoms which we in the Labor Party will always defend and promote.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second bill being debated today is the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill. This sets up a registration scheme for persons who act on behalf of foreign governments, foreign government related entities or individuals and foreign political organisations seeking to influence an Australian governmental or political process. As with the espionage and foreign interference bill, the parliamentary joint committee received many submissions opposing the bill which pointed out that thousands of Australian individuals and organisations whose foreign connections were entirely overt would have been required to register under the bill as originally put forward. It was quickly apparent that substantial changes were needed, and the government has now responded with a range of amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, it is fair to say that what the parliament is now debating is a very different bill—some might say entirely different—to the one introduced by Mr Turnbull in December. It was the subject of a further short inquiry in its amended form, with submissions called for once more from all those who had made submissions earlier to the committee. This resulted in some 30 further submissions, a hearing conducted by the committee last Monday and some extremely disciplined and active work by both the committee and its secretariat over the next week, which led to the tabling of the report of the committee on Monday recommending a further 40 changes to those suggested by the Attorney-General on 7 June. Those changes have further narrowed the scope of the bill so that it is now clear that the registration scheme is to focus on the activities of foreign governments, foreign government related individuals and entities and foreign political organisations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill now makes clear that a foreign political organisation is to be treated as a foreign political party or an organisation which is directed wholly or primarily to political activity. The amendments in the EM make clear that an environmental group or other civil society group whose activities are directed to other matters and not solely to political activity is not intended by the parliament to be caught by the term 'foreign political organisation'. The scope of registrable activities has also been limited to cover parliamentary and general political lobbying undertaken for the sole or primary purpose of political or government influence. These changes largely exempt media organisations, charities, arts and cultural organisations, trade unions and religious organisations, who risked being innocently swept in under the original provisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In its original form this bill was, as Mr Dreyfus said, using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. I thank the government for listening to the many concerns expressed by so many informed and expert commentators and, in doing so, ensuring this bill now operates in the way intended. I finish on this note: we have placed on record our concerns about the original drafting of the legislation and the way in which the government proceeded with it. However, notwithstanding those criticisms, I do acknowledge the extraordinary amount of work that staff and officers of the Attorney-General's Department have engaged in to bring this bill to the parliament, to reflect the amendments that were flagged as being required from public submissions and also to bring into effect, via amendment, the recommendations of the parliamentary joint committee. So I acknowledge the work of those officers—and I note that there are officers from the Attorney-General's Department here in the chamber. I particularly acknowledge the work of Dr Anna Dacre and other members of the secretariat, who have performed a great national service in the work they have done to ensure that the committee's report could be landed in a form which enabled this legislation to proceed. Finally, I thank the senators and members who work with me on the joint committee.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="JKM" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKIM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:43</span>):  At the outset, I want to state very clearly that the Australian Greens do acknowledge the need to guard against malicious foreign interference in our democratic processes in Australia. We've seen, in other countries, very serious, malicious and, in some cases, successful attempts by foreign powers to covertly influence and interfere in democratic processes. Two examples I'd use there are the Brexit vote in the United Kingdom and the most recent United States presidential election. Both of those processes were the subject of malicious and significant foreign interference. And that foreign interference undoubtedly had at least some influence on the outcomes of those two processes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But you do not defend democracy by smothering it. You do not defend democracy by cracking down on things like public interest journalism and civil society. And, unfortunately, that is exactly the approach that these two pieces of legislation take. This legislation will have a serious impact on freedom of speech, on freedom of political communication and on the political debate in this country. And I'll go to some advice from experts on that, and place that on the record. But before I do that, I want to say very clearly that this legislation, as it currently stands, should be rejected by the Senate. These bills will criminalise a wide range of peaceful and non-violent protests, and journalists could face lengthy jail terms for legitimate public interest journalism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're in this position because the Liberals are committed to clamping down on dissent. And there is example after example to support that assertion. But we're also in this position because the Labor Party are too scared to oppose the Liberals when they crackdown on dissent. And they're too scared, as I said earlier, because they don't want to open up a wafer of difference between them and the government on issues that the government claims are around counterterrorism and national security. And that's a shame. It is a shame, because it's the country that loses out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen the consequences of this bipartisan policy lock step in other areas, such as, for example, the detention on Manus Island and Nauru of innocent people seeking asylum. I've been to Manus Island many times. I've seen the human suffering that occurs as a consequence of this policy lock step, which, at its heart, is happening because of Labor's political cowardice. Labor is scared of Minister Dutton and his extreme right-wing cronies. They're scared of the access they've got, through radio talkback, to those parts of this country that Labor and the Liberals regard as key marginal seats. And the tragedy here is that Labor's political fear has crippled its ability to fight back. It's crippled Labor's ability to push back against draconian and dangerous legislation, such as what we are debating right now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've said it before, and I'm going to say it again, because this stuff needs to be called out: we are shuffling ever more rapidly down the road to a police state, ever more rapidly down the pathway to a surveillance state and ever more rapidly down the road towards authoritarianism, totalitarianism and fascism in this country. And if you think that some of those terms are overreach, I invite senators to read Madeleine Albright's recently published book <span style="font-style:italic;">Fascism: A Warning</span>. I invite senators to read that book. I invite them to look at the warnings by Ms Albright, a former Secretary of State of the United States under Bill Clinton, to understand the points she is making and to heed the warning she is making, in the context of the United States, that there are early warning signs of fascism in that country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And do you know what, Mr Acting Deputy President Ketter? There are earlier warning signs of fascism in our country too. There's an undermining of the rule of law. There's the deliberate demonisation of an external group of people. There is a disdain for human rights. There's a disdain for freedom of the press. There's an unhealthily close relationship between the old political parties in this country and the big corporates who donate so generously to the re-election coffers of the Labor Party and the coalition, who get, in return, public policy benefits. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to Labor, if they are scared of Minister Dutton and his extreme right-wing cronies, leave. Get out of the parliament and make way in this place for people who are prepared to stand up to it. That's what we need to see in this place. I do want to be fair to the Labor Party, and I do accept Senator Wong's comments on face value that the bills are improved by the processes that were undertaken through the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. I accept and agree that the bills have been improved. That process rasped off a few of the roughest edges in this legislation. I'm not sure whether Senator Wong's comments were referring to my previous contribution when she said that it is wrong to suggest that the legislation has not been subject to inquiry and that the Australian people have not had the capacity to make submissions and attend hearings. I do accept that the original pieces of legislation did allow for submissions to be made from the Australian public and from civil society in Australia. What has not been the subject of that opportunity, though, are the 280 amendments that we only saw for the first time publicly yesterday afternoon and which, less than 24 hours later, we are debating in this chamber. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those amendments have not been put through any scrutiny process at all in the context of this parliament, most specifically in the context of the Senate. That's why it was so disappointing that Labor and the coalition colluded yesterday to deny and oppose the Australian Greens' motion on the entire legislation—that is, the original bills that went into the joint standing committee on intelligence and security along with the recommendations and, importantly, the amendments that were drafted as a result of those recommendations that came out of the joint standing committee on intelligence and security. As I've said a few times, there are 280 amendments. We've had less than 24 hours to get across them. There's been no capacity for the Australian public, including civil society, to have their say directly through the processes of this Senate because the old parties got together, stitched up a dirty deal and voted down a Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry. So here we are again: a dirty deal through the closed shop of the PJCIS. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens' position is on the record that the crossbench ought to have a representative on that committee. We simply reject the argument that has been made by Senator Wong today and by members of the coalition in the past that this process should be reserved for what they describe as 'the parties of government'. This Senate is about more than who forms government. To state the bleeding obvious, government flows from a majority in the other place, not in this place. This Senate as a chamber ought to be standing up for the right to have reasonable representation for the crossbench on that committee. It's a deal stitched up behind closed doors, but it's also a dud deal. There are still significant concerns with this legislation that it will criminalise peaceful protests and there are still significant and legitimate concerns that it will criminalise public interest journalism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills mean that people could face 15 years in jail for a peaceful protest such as blocking access to a port where people are trying to load live sheep for export, and people could face 15 years in jail for blockading against the Adani coalmine, supported by the Labor Party and the coalition in this place. Journalists could face up to 25 years imprisonment for reporting on, for example, the Australian government spying on a foreign power, as we know we did with East Timor. They could criminalise a journalist for reporting that the Australian government is engaged in egregious human rights abuses, which we know they are on Manus Island and Nauru. I'll be going to these matters in detail once we get to the committee stages of these bills. As we've seen in the metadata laws stitch-up and as we've seen in the ongoing erosion of civil liberties in the name of national security, where we have witnessed, in the last 20 years, over 200 pieces of legislation passed through parliaments in Australia that erode fundamental rights and freedoms, the agreements between the old political parties are letting down the Australian people and are actually letting down our democracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, it's not just the Australian Greens. In fact, we're proud to be in here today representing a large cross-section of civil society and reflecting their concerns about these bills as amended, and we're also proud to be in here with the capacity to place other people's opinions on the record. To start doing that, I want to quote from George Williams, Dean of the University of New South Wales Faculty of Law and constitutional law expert, who spoke about the legislation on 11 June this year. Before I quote him, I'll make it clear that he was making these comments before the amendments were public but with the capacity to understand the recommendations from the committee. Professor Williams said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Even with the changes of the parliamentary joint committee, the bill will remain incomplete and dangerous. It will contain overbroad and uncertain definitions of critical concepts such as national security. The law also will undermine freedom of speech and of the press.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As in past inquiries, the committee has given low weight to these values. It has failed to put forward amendments to prevent journalists being imprisoned ... The possibility also remains that people who publish information about Australia’s economic and political relations with other countries will face jail under new espionage offences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what we've got here is the government and Labor getting up and saying, 'Relax, people. Chill out. We've sorted it all out in the committee. Everything's fine,' and then we've got Professor Williams making it very clear that everything's not fine. One of the foremost experts on constitutional law, counter-terrorism law and national security law in the country is warning this parliament and the Australian people that everything is not fine and it's not okay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's not just Professor Williams. There have been reports of comments from Ms Kate Eastman SC, who is the founder of Australian Lawyers for Human Rights. Ms Eastman informed <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span> recently of some of her concerns. In the context of the provisions in these bills that criminalise the publication of certain information, the article said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Eastman told Guardian Australia those concepts "could cover almost anything" that embarrasses Australia in the eyes of another country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span> says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Eastman cited examples of reporting that Australia spied on the Indonesian president and his wife, spied on Timor L'Este, criticism of Australia's human rights record connected to its role on the United Nations Human Rights Council, or its treatment of foreign investment and major projects such as the Adani Carmichael coalmine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, we've got Ms Eastman raising warnings but the Labor Party, through its shadow Attorney-General, Mr Dreyfus, saying it's not correct that peaceful protest would be somehow criminalised. However, those comments were contradicted by Ms Eastman, according to <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span>. We've also got legal advice provided together. Because time will prevent me from quoting that at length in this speech, I will place that on the record later.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to conclude my speech by pointing out that while civil society groups—non-government organisations—are bound by the provisions in this law, corporations and politicians are exempt. It's the corporatisation of power in this country and in Western democracies around the world that is at the foundation of so much of the environmental harm that's being done and at the foundation of so many of the human rights abuses that are occurring. It's because parliaments have voted to hand over the power to the big corporates that we're seeing our ecosystem trashed and human lives treated like garbage. It's because parliaments have gutlessly withdrawn their capacity to control corporations and handed over power to the closed doors of the corporate boardrooms. To suggest that for-profit businesses that might be involved in, for example, poker machines—let alone organisations like churches or the Vatican—are less of a risk to Australian politics than non-government organisations and civil society groups is either woefully naive or wilfully negligent. These corporates have more influence, more resources, more power and closer connection to politics and politicians than do non-government organisations.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, very quickly, I need to be clear about the amendments. We have not had the opportunity to adequately scrutinise the 280 amendments to these two pieces of legislation, even to satisfy ourselves that they adequately reflect the recommendations from the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and Security. There is simply no way we have had the capacity to do that. That's why we voted against the government exempting these bills from the cut-off order. That cut-off order is specifically designed to ensure that this Senate has a reasonable opportunity to scrutinise legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I accept that the Labor Party has been involved in a process that's made improvements, but I do not accept that those improvements have taken these bills to a place where this Senate ought support them. This Senate should reject these bills because, if passed, they will have a chilling effect on democracy in our country. As I said at the start, you don't protect democracy by smothering it. Public speech and public interest journalism are at the heart of a thriving, vibrant democracy and, if these bills pass, Australia's democracy will be less thriving and less vibrant than it needs to be. I move the first of two amendments circulated in my name:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="121628" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McALLISTER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:04</span>):  Australia is an intellectually, politically and commercially open society—that is a strength, not a weakness. Over our history, our openness to people and the ideas that they bring have underpinned our economic, social and political successes as a nation. These characteristics are broadly reflected, recognised and protected in our national policy settings, including the settings for trade and economic development; elections; judicial, governmental and parliamentary decision making; communications; research and education; migration and settlement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Openness should not cease to be a defining characteristic of Australian society. It's worth observing that the vast bulk of international influence on our open society is benign and indeed beneficial. This open characteristic is something, however, that depends on Australians continuing to have faith in the institutions that protect our democratic and open system. We need to be confident that they are robust and sufficiently resistant to malicious actors. There is a balance to be struck here. We need laws to protect our societies against those who would seek to use our very openness against us, but, by the same token, those laws cannot be allowed to stifle the exchange of ideas, people and commerce that have been so crucial to our success as a nation. We've always had laws on our books that seek to strike this balance. Offences like espionage and sabotage are not new. They are, in fact, very old. One of the key purposes of this bill is to update and refine these offences to make sure they operate as they are intended and as we need them to operate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bills also introduce new offences that seek to criminalise the activities of foreign actors who seek to interfere covertly with Australia's democratic processes. The bills also introduce measures that will shed light on the extent to which foreign actors influence Australian political debate. The parliament has been advised that foreign actors are actively seeking to covertly influence Australian politics. These warnings arise as part of broader advice in relation to the level and nature of espionage. We accept those warnings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The notion of foreign influence introduces a relatively new concept into contemporary Australian political discussion. In recent times Australians have not been concerned with foreign influence per se. Specific practices or ideas associated with foreign cultures or nations have been rejected as inconsistent with our values and interests in the ordinary course of democratic debate. At other times, of course, practices and ideas associated with foreign cultures or nations have been enthusiastically adopted. We've generally judged that that has been managed in the framework of our existing institutions, but it is necessary for our laws to keep pace with the changing nature of threats we face as an open and democratic society. As has been seen in some examples overseas, doubts about the authenticity and genuineness of participants in public debate can achieve the very outcome we would seek to avoid: a closed and suspicious society. This is the basis on which Labor has sought to engage with the security challenges facing our society today, and, indeed, to engage with the bills that are before this chamber. Throughout this process, we have acted to affirm and protect the role of the media and of civil society. Journalists, charities, advocacy groups and unions are not threats. In fact, they play an important part in preserving and promoting Australia's open and democratic tradition. Our laws should reflect this. Unfortunately, when these bills were first introduced into the parliament, they did not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security has conducted detailed inquiries into both of these bills. In doing so, we've benefitted enormously from the submissions made by civil society. They include organisations like Law Council of Australia, Australian Lawyers For Human Rights, Universities Australia, Australian Catholic Bishops Conference, Joint Media Organisations, Community Council for Australia, Australian Major Performing Arts Group, Australian Conservation Foundation, The Pew Charitable Trusts, Australian Council for International Development, Australian Council of Trade Unions and Multicultural Communities Council of NSW. That is just a sample. There are too many who submitted to name all of them. We received hundreds of submissions and we took public evidence through the first six months of this year. I am so grateful for all of the contributions that came from civil society and, indeed, from Australian businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The submissions received by the committee made it clear that both of these bills were deeply flawed on first presentation. They contained numerous drafting errors, significant overreach and inadequate safeguards. There was no recognition of the unique and important role played by media in civil society. In response, the committee has made more than 100 recommendations for amendments across the two bills. The government have accepted all of these recommendations, and I thank them for their consideration of the committee's recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments proposed to the espionage and foreign interference bill, particularly to schedule 2 of the bill, were inquired into the by the PJCIS. Submitters to the PJCIS made supplementary submissions on the March amendments, and I would say to other senators that they may wish to examine the evidence provided both on the initial bills and also on the evidence provided to the committee on the amendments. On the further amendments that are before us today, the amended bill responds to the recommendations of the committee and we are satisfied that these amendments implement the PJCIS recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is fair to say that the bills presently before this chamber are not the same as the bills that were first introduced. They do a far better job at protecting our democratic institutions without burdening them. I want to briefly address some of the key improvements that have been made to the bill as a result of the committee's recommendations and explain how they safeguard journalists, advocacy groups, NGOs, unions and, ultimately, and the openness of our society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to journalists, I want to make a few remarks, because they have been the subject of some debate already this morning. The espionage and foreign interference bill includes updated secrecy provisions to protect Australia against espionage efforts by foreign government principles. These include offences relating to theft of trade secrets. I recognise the potential tension between these offences and the proper role of the media. There is a quote ascribed to almost a dozen different 20th century media proprietors and journalists—who knows who actually said it—that 'News is something that someone wants to suppress.' Through the PJCIS process, Labor has ensured that there are proper exemptions for journalists and others who are legitimately engaged in the process of reporting the news and commenting on current events, and I thank all members of the committee for their interest in these issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to advocacy groups, I do observe that this government has spent the last few years trying to curtail the ability of charities to raise their voice and make a difference—and I've spoken about it in this chamber before. Sometimes it seems as though the government thinks that the only role for charities should be to provide services that the government can't be bothered to provide. If people have that view they should join the Liberal Party and raise it at their local branch. This view of charities and NGOs is wrong and dangerous. Civil society plays a unique and important role in public debate, and we need to distinguish charities from other advocates in public debate. It's true that there's a role for everybody in public debate—industry associations, peak bodies, business—and it is important that we hear the voices of those who may be affected by a particular decision or policy. But their role usually is to advance their members' interests or their own interests. There should be a place in our public discourse for people who aren't motivated by self-interest but instead by their vision of what we can and should be. There should be a role for civil society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through the PJCIS process, we have sought to protect the role of civil society. Charities are already subject to significant regulation around their funding and activities. Given this, charities will be exempted from having to register under the Foreign Influence and Transparency Scheme where they are making routine representations in accordance with their respective purposes. The charities I have spoken to have been overwhelmingly positive about this change. This change includes not only advocacy groups but also arts and cultural groups that may have been caught up in the scheme as previously drafted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I finally want to speak about peaceful protest. The espionage and foreign interference bill includes offences regarding sabotage. We have always had sabotage offences on our books, and this bill clarifies their operation. It is simply not correct that these offences criminalise peaceful protest. These provisions are simply not capable of capturing the ordinary activities of citizens involved in ordinary acts of process. The crucial point is that these offences require intent. A person needs to have the intent or be reckless as to whether Australia's national security will be prejudiced. A protest at a coal port involves people who are protesting to stop coal exports. That is their intent. They do not intend to prejudice Australia's national security. Whether you agree with the protest methods or not, the protesters do not possess the requisite mental intent, the requisite mental element, to make out these offences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been concerns raised in some quarters that the espionage offences are capable of criminalising the disclosure of alleged breaches of law by Australia or another country. The example sometimes given is an NGO reporting to a UN body that Australia has breached its international law and human rights obligations. Again, these offences require a mental element. They need to cause harm or damage to Australia, not merely embarrassment. These concerns are not justified.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor and I are proud to support the exemption for unions from the operation of the register. The trade union movement has always operated internationally, and it is appropriate that their international relationships are legitimised and accepted. I have run through a series of issues. If Greens senators have a different view about the operation of the legislation, they need to particularise them. Greens senators ought to describe exactly how the legislation catches the circumstances that they assert are caught. It is not enough to repeat over and over again that certain kinds of activities will be caught when a reading of the legislation suggests that they won't be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will conclude by saying that we are not served at all by those who resort to hyperbole. Charges of totalitarianism or fascism only serve to weaken the force of those words.. We should reserve the use of those words to condemn situations that truly deserve it. These laws, and indeed all our laws, operate in the context of independent courts, freedom of expression and open parliamentary democracy. It is true that, if you take away those three things, any law can be used as a tool of oppression. But those circumstances are not our circumstances, and it is precisely why we have engaged with these policy questions. We seek to protect the integrity of our democratic institutions and the openness of our society.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="53369" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DI NATALE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:17</span>):  The National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill and the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill are part of what is effectively a Trojan horse to clamp down on civil society here in Australia. It is disgraceful that we have a supposedly liberal government that is prepared to introduce these laws. Worse still, we have these laws being passed with the enthusiastic support of the opposition. The fact that the Labor Party is facilitating these bills speaks volumes about their lack of courage to take on a government that is prepared to weaken our democracy. Now more than ever we need to stand up in defence of our democratic institutions. At a time when many regimes across the world are retreating into nationalism and authoritarianism, it is critical that here in Australia we protect and nurture our democratic institutions. If there is one lesson we have learnt from history it is that, across the world, over many years, movements like the civil rights movement, the struggle for women's rights and the peace movement were successful because they were built from the ground up by people coming together and exerting pressure on governments. What they demonstrate is that if we are to achieve progressive change in this country, and indeed right around the world, we need to support our democratic institutions and support those movements that ensure we put maximum pressure on governments, who will always retreat to the comfortable area of concentrating power in their hands.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government, cheered on by the ALP, seems determined to make sure we have a weak civil society in this country, one that is increasingly hamstrung and powerless. We expect that from conservative governments. This is part of the DNA of conservative governments. If we look at the Liberal National Party attacks on civil society, which began many, many years ago—well before it foreshadowed it's so-called foreign influence package—we witnessed the relentless criticism from the government on the independent Human Rights Commission and it's then commissioner, Gillian Triggs, because they didn't like what she had to say. We saw attack after attack, spurred on by a compliant corporate media, against somebody who was prepared to speak truth to power.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals established the Registered Organisations Commission with the express purpose of attacking unions. They established the royal commission into unions and, of course, have precious little to show for it. We saw the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters launch its inquiry into the last federal election. Of course, it was a platform for the likes of Senator Abetz and his cronies to criticise any organisation that might disagree with his and the Liberal Party's view. Right now, the Australian Electoral Commission is still investigating whether GetUp! is an associated entity that is a front group of not one political party but two very different political parties—so fathom that. We have Senator Abetz clamping down on civil society institutions, claiming that they're front groups not just for the Labor Party but also for the Greens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had the shameful, politically motivated raid on the Australian Workers' Union, all to determine whether the union gave donations according to union rules more than a decade ago. It was carefully orchestrated, with the media arriving before the raid occurred. The list goes on and on. There is clamping down on whistleblowers who seek to call out what is happening in detention centres offshore. It's part of a worrying pattern of behaviour, where governments that are in trouble use the apparatus of the state to silence dissent. What we're seeing now is part of a sustained attack on our democracy. And now we've got the government introducing this package of legislation that will create laws to muzzle civil society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, as I said, we expect this from Liberal governments. It's part of their DNA. There's nothing 'liberal' about this government; this is a government that has shown itself to be increasingly authoritarian. But what is most disappointing here is that that ALP has simply crumbled. You've got the Turnbull government here seeking to silence dissent and seeking to clamp down on civil society, and all with the complicity of the Australian Labor Party. And, of course, that's why both parties are rushing this legislation through the parliament. Let's remember that this is literally two days after a secretive committee on intelligence and security, one in which the Greens and other crossbench members are not participants, released more a more-than-300-page report. As a consequence of that, we saw hundreds of amendments made in the House, and we're now being asked to consider the impacts of this legislation. We know what's going to come next. It's only a matter of time before we see an hours motion, and we're going to be forced to pass this legislation at a minute to midnight, under the cloak of darkness, so that we don't fully interrogate and understand laws that are being passed in this parliament. It's no way to run a country, and that's why my colleague Senator McKim has repeatedly tried to refer this bill to another public and transparent committee for consideration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no excuse for the Labor Party to deny us the opportunity to interrogate this legislation through a thorough committee process. And it is shameful that it is with the support of the Labor Party that we have seen any committee process that enables us to fully understand the extent of these laws being stopped as a result of their support of the LNP. The ALP could have taken a principled stance here. They could have taken a stance: they could have stood up to the government and said, 'We understand the need to ensure that we minimise foreign interference in Australian matters. However, these laws are far reaching.' They are extensive. In the words of many experts and analysts, 'They do take us closer to those authoritarian regimes we seek to defend ourselves against.' Because these laws have a whisper of national security about them, the Labor Party simply doesn't have the ticker to do it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we have national security being used in this parliament, it is almost always used as an excuse for a bipartisan consensus to ram through laws without any scrutiny. The effect is that the ALP and the government have come together to make Australian society less free and less democratic. Let's look at that legal advice we heard from our previous speaker. In the last few days we've seen legal advice that tells us the espionage bill could criminalise protests and the communication of opinions harmful to the Australian government. Somebody who is peacefully blockading entry to a coalmine could be charged with an offence under the espionage bill and could face up to 20 years in jail. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the founder of Australian Lawyers for Human Rights, Kate Eastman, criticism of Australia's human rights records or its treatment of foreign investments in projects such as the Adani coalmine could fall foul of these laws. Amnesty International is spot on when they say, 'These draconian laws proposed will make Australia more like the authoritarian countries this bill is supposed to protect us from.' That's not hyperbole. That's a statement of fact. It's a statement of fact from a respected international institution whose only mandate is to uphold and protect human rights across the world. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't for a second deny the fact that the Australian government should do what it can to counter undue foreign influence in Australia. We don't want foreign governments or foreign entities to influence what we do in this country. But if we're serious about that, if we are serious about restricting the impact of foreign corporations or foreign governments on Australian political activity, we know what needs to be done. The best way to tackle that problem is to dry up the supply of money. The only way to do that is to implement serious reforms that cap political donations and increase transparency. If you don't want foreign influence in Australia, stop the flow of money. Make it illegal to donate to Australian political parties. Make it illegal for foreign corporations and foreign governments to make massive donations to the Liberal Party and the National Party and the Labor Party. Neither side of politics wants that, because they benefit from the rivers of gold that flow from multinational corporations and entities associated with foreign governments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've been campaigning on donation reform for years. The recent Select Committee into the Political Influence of Donations, a committee that I chaired, has shown that cash is still king in Australian politics. If we want to end foreign influence let's put an end to the cosy relationship between big business, foreign multinationals and our political parties. Let's cap donations and let's cap spending. As things stand, dark money can flow into old political parties' war chests without any scrutiny as to what that money is buying. Look at the Minerals Council, for example. The Minerals Council of Australia is 86 per cent foreign owned. It's spent half a billion dollars of tax deductible donations, over the past decades, lobbying Australian governments. Why does it do it? It does it to influence what is going on in this place. It doesn't do it because it's a philanthropic organisation that wants to support democracy. It does it because it wants to exert influence over government policy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can have all the legislation in the world that seeks to curb foreign influence in Australia, but until we deal with the cancer that is the millions of dollars that flow into the coffers of both sides of politics, from huge multinational corporations, we will go nowhere near enough to curbing the influence that this bill seeks to do. If this government and the ALP were truly serious about countering foreign influence in this country, the first thing they would be doing would be legislating to cap political donations, not rushing through laws that criminalise dissent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are laws that clamp down on civil society. These are laws that may criminalise political protest in this country. These are laws that, rather than protecting us from authoritarian regimes, take us closer to those regimes we say we are seeking to protect ourselves from. These bills are a disgrace. We expect nothing more from the Liberal and National parties, but it is a sad indictment on the Labor Party that it is willing to support them.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KITCHING</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:30</span>):  I welcome this chance to speak on these important bills, the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2017 and the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill 2017. They are this parliament's bipartisan response to the threat of foreign states and hostile non-state actors exerting improper influence over our democratic system of government, our political landscape, our alliances and our decision-making process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A very important part of the process of achieving consensus on security legislation has been the work of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. This committee works on a consensus basis and enjoys the confidence of both government and opposition members. It's for that reason that I think the members of the Senate should read and take seriously the committee's report on the espionage bill. I would like to commend all members of that committee, but I would particularly like to commend my colleagues in the Senate, Senator Wong and Senator McAllister, and Senator Fawcett, and my friends in the other place: Mr Andrew Hastie, the chair of the committee, and the deputy chair, Mr Anthony Byrne.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The gist of the committee's report is summed up in the following blunt statement:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the Committee has received compelling evidence that Australia is facing an unprecedented threat from espionage and foreign interference. The Committee has also received evidence that current laws are not adequate to deal with this threat. Unchecked, espionage has the potential to significantly reduce Australia's long-term security, and foreign interference could undermine our democracy and threaten the rights and freedoms of our people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has therefore recommended to the parliament that:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… there is a pressing need to strengthen and modernise current espionage and foreign interference laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I accept that the provisions of the first version of the bill were drafted in good faith. I don't agree with the Greens political party that the parties that form government have some sinister authoritarian motive in designing that bill. The bill has been through an appropriate and extensive process in the intelligence and security committee of this parliament. And of course, earlier this month, the committee released a 400-page report. It is a public document. Neither the government nor the opposition has sought to keep this secret, as the Greens political party speakers have suggested in their contributions this morning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bills now have a more nuanced approach. They take into account some of the principles that make our Judaeo-Christian Western liberal democracy the precious system that it is. In the first version of the bills, there would have been an unacceptable impact on the openness of our democratic society. For example, they would have perhaps threatened journalists with severe criminal penalties for reporting on matters that might have embarrassed the government. They would have imposed unjustified burdens on charities. They would have perhaps required any Australian academic engaged in joint work with an overseas university to register as a foreign agent. The bills before us currently, though, and which we are debating, do have a more nuanced approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But our system is precious. It is a way of life that allows people to breathe deeply in the air of freedom and to live their life with a liberty that also allows for the honouring of a social contract. There is an honesty in this way of life. For security legislation to be effective in achieving its objectives, it must command broad support in the Australian community. To gain that support, it must meet three criteria: it must be clear and unambiguous in its terms, it must be proportional and appropriately targeted to the threat, and it must be enforceable. This bill complies with these criteria.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens political party would have you believe that some of the provisions of this bill are somewhat alarming. But we have seen in the past that every time security legislation is brought to this parliament, a chorus of voices is raised proclaiming that the new laws represent the end of freedom and democracy and the dawn of a new age of authoritarianism. These fears always turn out to be grossly exaggerated. Despite 15 years of new security legislation, Australian democracy remains as robust as ever. Our media remains as free as ever. Our judiciary remains ever-vigilant and ever-ready to strike down legislation that it deems has infringed on our freedoms. Civil society organisations remain as free to investigate, to criticise and to protest as ever they were. Nothing in this bill, as it has been amended, will change any of that. That is why I find it regrettable that some on the crossbench always make these wild accusations of sinister government conspiracies. They need to learn from the story of the boy who cried wolf. If every piece of security legislation, no matter how carefully drafted, is denounced as the end of freedom as we know it in this country, we run the risk that when real threats—real threats, as described by our security agencies—to our freedom appear then warnings will not be heeded.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The national security bills are necessary because is it absolutely undesirable to have foreign interference in our political system. We must also protect our civil society—for example, our media and our universities—from being penetrated in a more insidious manner. This modern form of soft power is much harder to combat than the crude efforts of totalitarian societies of the last century. These laws are necessary, and I trust that the parties that can form government will use them wisely. But trust is not enough. As Ronald Reagan used to say, 'Trust, but verify.' It is up to us in this parliament, as well as up to the media, the courts and civil society, to verify that these powers are not abused. I think the history of the past 20 years shows that we in Australia are up to the task of holding our governments to account for the way they use the powers this parliament gives them. It is up to all of us in this parliament to be attentive to that responsibility.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATRICK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:37</span>):  Last December, the Turnbull government introduced the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2017 and the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill 2017. Both bills have been the subject of six months' scrutiny by the PJCIS, which has produced two reports—the first tabled on 7 June and the second tabled on Monday this week. Together, these two reports total 754 pages. The first report contains no less than 60 recommendations. The second report contains 52 recommendations. There's a lot here for the Senate to digest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills go to the core of our national sovereignty, the ability of our democratic institutions to function free of covert foreign interference. They also have very significant implications for key institutions and processes within our democratic system: implications for the parliament and political processes more broadly and, more specifically, implications for the role and influence of our security and police agencies, and for the operations of the free press. Centre Alliance agrees with the necessity for this legislation; however, at the same time the Senate should be alert to all of the implications. We should be prepared to look at other legislative change that will strengthen our democratic institutions, ensure our security agencies are fully accountable and politically impartial, and ensure that government is, to the maximum extent possible, open to scrutiny by the media and its citizens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The threat of foreign espionage and covert foreign interference is very real. That is certainly the advice of our security agencies. In evidence to the PJCIS, ASIO advised that espionage and foreign interference activities against Australian interests is 'occurring at an unprecedented scale'. The threat from foreign espionage and foreign interference is described as 'extensive, unrelenting and increasingly sophisticated'. More specifically, ASIO told the committee:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This isn't something that we think might happen or could happen; it is happening now against Australian interests in Australia and ... abroad.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Foreign actors from a range of countries seek access to privileged and/or classified information on Australia's alliances and partnerships, our position on international diplomatic, economic and military issues, our energy and mineral resources and our innovations in science and technology.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, it can be argued that espionage and, indeed, sabotage are nothing new. After all, spying has often been described as the second-oldest profession. But ASIO rightly points out that the nature and scale of the threat has evolved and grown significantly. Foreign intelligence services are increasingly using a wider range of techniques to obtain intelligence and clandestinely interfere with Australia's internal affairs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It isn't only the intelligence communities that have highlighted these threats. Investigative journalists—notably, Fairfax and the ABC—have played an important part in highlighting issues relating to foreign interference, espionage and, indeed, foreign influence. Although the government is understandably reluctant to talk publicly about the specific espionage and interference threat posed by China, that is what this legislation is about. In the decades to come, Australia is likely to face even bigger challenges in managing our relations with China, our major trading partner, and that country is likely to exert perhaps significantly more influence in our region. In the years and decades to come, China's reach and influence in our region, and inside Australia itself, will likely be the single most important issue in Australian national security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The challenge in this legislation is how, in an environment in which national security threats and pressures are likely to increase, do we strike the right balance between measures to protect our national sovereignty whilst ensuring the fundamental freedoms and key institutions that we have are not compromised. On this, I want to focus attention on two aspects: the espionage and official secrecy provisions of the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill and the broad question of foreign interference that is addressed through the bill and the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new official secrecy provisions in schedule 2 of the espionage and foreign interference bill are not completely new. Rather, they are the latest and most sophisticated proposal to update Australia's counter-espionage legislation and replace the very dated official secrecy provisions of sections 70 and 79 of the Crimes Act. As originally proposed, the scope of the new official secrecy provisions was unacceptably broad, especially as it related to what has been referred to as 'secondary disclosures'—that is, the handling and publication of information by third parties, including journalists and media organisations. The practical effect of the bill would be to make it a criminal offence for unauthorised persons—including journalists and media organisations—to obtain, retain, communicate or publish any government information disclosed without official authorisation that falls into the category of information that would 'cause harm to Australia's interest' or is 'inherently harmful information'. The bill provided a defence to a prosecution on the grounds that the person's conduct related to the communication of information in the public interest and in the person's capacity as a journalist engaged in 'fair and accurate reporting'. The term 'fair and accurate reporting', however, was vague and subjective. The bill's explanatory memorandum makes it clear that the government's expectation has been—and presumably still is—that media organisations and journalists would consult with the government as they determined what to do with leaked information. This is presented as a necessary part of what would be required to determine where the public interest rests and to make a defence. A clear presumption is that a failure to consult and seek advice would weigh against reliance on the public interest or fair reporting defence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As originally proposed, the bill would have a severe chilling effect on the media reporting of an unauthorised release of information relating to national security, defence, international affairs, law enforcement, public safety and, indeed, much wider aspects of public policy. Media organisations and journalists would have to weigh the likelihood of prosecution in any decision to publish leaked information. Given the prospects of expensive litigation and possible criminal penalties if a public interest defence was unsuccessful, many media organisations may be inclined towards caution on commercial and legal grounds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not surprisingly, these issues were a major focus of the PJCIS hearings, with media organisations making extensive submissions on the adverse impact the bill would have on freedom of the press. The outcome has been a range of recommendations and amendments that reduce and focus the scope of secrecy offences—focusing on the disclosure of and dealing in explicitly security classified information—protect people making disclosures to oversight agencies such as IGIS, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, and the Ombudsman, and afford journalists and media organisations a greater measure of protection.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most significantly, the PJCIS has recommended the adoption of the proposed government amendments to the defence for journalists, including expanding the defence to all persons engaged in reporting news, presenting current affairs or expressing editorial content in news media where the person reasonably believed that dealing with or holding the information was in the public interest. The committee also recommended that the government consider further refinements to the proposed defence in order to make it explicit that editorial support staff are covered by the defence, including legal advisers and administrative staff, and to include a defence for dealing with information for the purpose of obtaining legal advice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These proposed changes go some way towards reducing the concern that the original version of the bill would have a chilling effect on journalism. That said, the parliament shouldn't gloss over the threshold that will be crossed. The bill, even as amended, will still make secondary disclosures of classified information an offence. Journalists and media organisations will have to very carefully weigh decisions about publishing leaked classified information, especially relating to national security or international relations. Just what is in the public interest will often be hotly contested by the government of the day, and the risk of expensive litigation—however small that might be—cannot be lightly dismissed. In that context, it is regrettable that the PJCIS did not examine the question of official secrecy and media and public access to government information from a wider perspective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is vital that, whenever the parliament seeks to clamp down on unauthorised disclosures of government information, we should also consider measures that would make government more transparent and assist the role of media and citizens in accessing information in accordance with law. To that end, Centre Alliance will be moving a set of amendments to the bill that are designed to improve the effectiveness of Australia's freedom of information laws to allow for more timely and efficient access to information. Whilst I acknowledge—noting that there has been a deal between Labor and Liberal—that these amendments are unlikely to gain support from the majority of senators, they are amendments that I will be pursuing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other major issue I'd like to highlight is the new foreign interference registration scheme to be established by the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill 2017. The explanatory memorandum notes that current Commonwealth criminal law does not contain any offences targeting conduct undertaken by a foreign government that falls short of espionage but is intended to harm Australia's national security or influence Australia's political or governmental processes. The Attorney-General's Department submitted:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill seeks to remedy this deficiency by introducing foreign interference offences which will criminalise certain conduct that seeks to influence the exercise of Australian democratic or political rights.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee recommends that the bill be amended to provide that the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme does not apply to members of the House of Representatives or senators. The committee further recommends that the House of Representatives and Senate develop a parallel parliamentary Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme, imposing on members and senators similar transparency obligations to those in the bills but appropriately adapted for the parliamentary environment.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That said, we should recognise that this bill will inevitably result in greater scrutiny of political activity not only by ASIO but also by the Australian Federal Police. This is inevitable by virtue of the offences that are being created, criminal offences that relate to political activities on behalf of a foreign principal. With this legislation, the AFP will investigate political activities if they reasonably suspect that those activities involve interaction with a foreign principal that is an offence under these bills. ASIO and the AFP may well be drawn into monitoring and investigating aspects of Australian political life—not on radical, violent fringes but on activities of people involved in mainstream political activities. In this context, this parliament—and, indeed, the Australian people—have an absolute assurance that those agencies are operating at every level with the highest standard of professionalism, objectivity and freedom from political bias. </span>

I also foreshadow that I will be moving a second reading amendment to refer the amendment on sheet 8472 for consideration by the PJCIS. I note that when this amendment was last debated, on 9 May, Senator McAllister said the following: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We regret that because of their form—namely, an amendment to the current bill—Senator Patrick's proposals were not able to be fully considered and were not considered in the public hearings of the PJCIS. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I accept that criticism, and this amendment seeks to remedy it. She went on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There has not been scope or time for proper consultation, nor for consideration of the operation and consequences of Senator Patrick's proposals. Given that, we are not able to support the amendment.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope that this time around Labor will support the amendment or, at least, have it referred to the PJCIS so that it can be considered properly. It's important to make sure that as we give our intelligence services the powers we think they need we also put in place the correct and proper checks to complement those extended powers. I agree that the PJCIS should have the opportunity to examine my amendment, given it directly relates to how they conduct their committee work. To that end, I look forward to Labor's support for my second reading amendment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a long-overdue reform that is all the more important in the context of the legislation we now have before the Senate. An extension of bipartisan parliamentary oversight is essential if ASIO and the AFP are to take on responsibilities that come with this legislation. I am very much a proponent of our intelligence services, and I have a strong belief that having the comfort of parliamentary oversight of those intelligence agencies will in fact make their job easier. In the US, the UK and Canada, some of our Five Eyes partners, they absolutely accept that parliamentary oversight of intelligence operations is a necessity and is helpful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to close my remarks with reference to an observation made by the former head of the British Secret Intelligence Service, Sir Richard Dearlove. Some years ago he observed that British intelligence was 'the last assurance of our national sovereignty'. Australia's intelligence community—the dedicated men and women of ASIO, the AFP, ASIS and the other agencies—are unquestionably committed to the defence of our sovereignty and democracy. But we must never forget the old question: who guards the guardians? At the end of the day, the last assurance of our national sovereignty and, indeed, our democracy is not the security agencies but this institution, the national parliament. We are where the buck stops, and the parliament should take up that responsibility by extending its oversight role in relation to our intelligence and security agencies.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="122087" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McCARTHY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:56</span>):  I rise to speak on the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill 2017. Labor believes in transparency. We have seen in the 2016 US presidential elections, in Brexit and in the French presidential election attempts by foreign powers to interfere with and influence the democratic processes in those countries. Labor is determined to shine a light on any covert or deceptive foreign influence that has the potential to corrode the governmental and political processes of our nation. We take the safeguarding of our free and fair elections very, very seriously.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was with these fundamental beliefs in mind that Labor approached the PJCIS inquiry into the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill. We welcome the fact that the government has recognised the need for significant fixes to its earlier bill, and there has certainly been a significant narrowing of the cohort of people in organisations that would be caught by this bill. In particular, Labor has worked constructively to ensure that charities, arts organisations, unions and religious organisations will generally be exempt from the operation of the scheme. The work of Australian charities here and abroad has had a tremendous impact on the lives of millions of people. Labor has always wanted this to work to continue without burdening our charities with unnecessary red tape. Labor also welcomes amendments that would create an exemption for arts organisations. Fostering cross-cultural artistic exchange is an essential part of maintaining and enhancing a vibrant multicultural Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill in its original form was far too broad in its definitions. For example, the original provisions could have gone so far as to impact the work of Indigenous rangers. Indigenous rangers' work in Indigenous protected areas is an incredible public benefit to Australia. But it is more than that. It has profoundly significant impacts on the lives of First Nations people. We talk in this House about closing the gap. We talk in this House about the importance of employment opportunities. Indigenous rangers across the coastlines of our country are doing tremendous work. They need far more support and certainly not red tape. They are tackling feral animal impacts and invasive weeds. They are ensuring fire is well managed. They are protecting cultural sites and managing tourism impacts. They are leaders in their communities under the guidance of their elders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own home community of Borroloola in the Gulf of Carpentaria, we have four language groups: the Yanyuwa, the Garrwa, the Marra and the Gudanji peoples. We have the li-Anthawirriyarra Rangers, whose name means 'our spiritual origin comes from the sea country'. And it is the sea country that the li-Anthawirriyarra Rangers look after. They protect the coastlines, they monitor the dugongs and sea turtles and they look at the harvesting that takes place. And they keep an eye out for any illegal activity. They certainly do Australia proud and they certainly do our communities proud.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports this critical work, not only to create jobs where they are desperately needed but to ensure that our beautiful country retains its natural and cultural heritage. We will seek change in any legislation that unreasonably inhibits or limits this kind of work, or, indeed, those advocating for it, whether they be Indigenous rangers and traditional owners themselves—many of whom I meet with regularly across the Northern Territory and certainly here in Canberra—whether they be the non-profit charities they work with, or, indeed, their own charities which they are forming to take control of their own circumstances. The recent FITS legislation, as proposed, significantly threatens the ability of Indigenous rangers and their partners to advocate freely for positive policy in Australia with regard to remote Indigenous jobs and for a healthy environment and cultural heritage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indigenous rangers are also incredibly significant because of the work of our women rangers—our strong women rangers—who have an opportunity to stand on par as carers for country. That's just one of the reasons my colleagues and I, particularly Mark Dreyfus, Andrew Leigh and Senator McAllister, were adamant that the bill had to go through the committee process. I'm pleased to say that our work was accepted by the committee members opposite, including Senator Abetz, who I understand presented detailed questioning to ensure that the feral camel issue was not somehow being used for ill intent by other countries through the rangers' work. This is quite a unique concern, but, nonetheless, I do congratulate the senator for his diligence and look forward to his further insights on the feral camel issue. I know that many rangers, especially in our desert regions across Central Australia—along the Arrarnta and the Anangu country—are working to address this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, more seriously, we must protect our democracy and we must protect our environment and culture. Part of that means being able to speak up freely—every Australian—for those things we do hold dear. Our rangers and Indigenous Protected Areas are doing wonderful work. Our country needs people; that's an important theme of First Nations rangers, particularly the many First Australians who have always cared for it. I will always fight for the expansion and security of that work in this place, and I hope that every senator here will see why and will stand strong in that too. We have a huge nation and we have much to care for. Let's work to extend and secure these jobs and that work more broadly, not threaten them inadvertently or otherwise through legislation that is badly drafted, rushed and ill considered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we're on the subject of foreign influence, I also just wanted to make a few brief comments surrounding the cuts to the ABC, and this government's efforts to discredit and, certainly, to dilute Australians' perceptions of our public broadcaster. I am passionate about this issue, because it does impact. One of those impacts was the ABC having to make the decision to discontinue ABC short-wave radio services in both rural Australia as well as the Pacific. Again, where short-wave radio was in northern Australia is now just silence. Our farmers and cattle stations, our Indigenous rangers and our fishermen and women out on the seas would use the short-wave radio of the ABC, and now there is no communication.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's interesting, and I have to note, that a government which claims to want to tackle foreign influence also wants to diminish Australian content and create a void for other agents of influence to fill. I am talking, of course, about the recent news reports that suggest that Radio Australia's former short-wave frequencies are now being used by China Radio International, that country's state owned overseas broadcaster. If we really want to counter foreign influence, it's hugely important that we have a properly funded public broadcaster that Australians can rely upon both at home and overseas.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:05</span>):  Well, it sounds like the cold war has returned: Australia's at risk, the nation's under threat, foreign agents abound, threatening our democracy; possibly they've taken the place of the 'reds under the bed'. Clearly action must be taken, but fortunately the major parties are here yet again to save us! They're collaborating. And it's nothing new for Labor, the Liberals and the Nationals to collaborate when it comes to so-called national security measures. Since 2002, can you believe—you probably can, sadly—67 pieces of legislation, so-called national security bills, have come here, with the Liberals, Labor and the Nationals all lining up to pass them together, with insufficient security and massive overreach, time and time again. I acknowledge that only six of those 67 bills have come from Labor, but Labor just comes on board every time the coalition government uses the words 'national security'. They've got to take a stand. Our democratic processes, the fundamental way this country works, have been eroded for well over a decade now because of this so-called national security scare, and it is being misused for the benefit of a certain section of this society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Richard Di Natale named that so clearly, as did Senator Nick McKim, when speaking about the corporate interests, particularly in this bill here—the way the voice of so many organisations will be curtailed, despite the amendments that went through the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. The committee's recommendations put forward a number of amendments; some of them are useful. But still these bills are irresponsible. One recommendation, as Senator McKim set out, is that we should have had the opportunity to send it to a Senate committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know we've got a big problem with this legislation because of the way it's been structured. Just going back to my theme about 'reds under the bed'—or foreign agents in this case, isn't it?—what we're left to conclude is that it's all these foreign agents, such as climate advocates, human rights advocates and many others working to make this a fairer, greener world. The organisations, the charities have now been looked after. That's good; we welcome that. But a number of not-for-profit organisations are out there advocating on so many important issues. Now, probably I and some of my colleagues wouldn't agree with them all, but that's not the issue. The issue is having the right to go out there and express yourself—take action, protest. But now the limitations and the penalties are quite extraordinary, so we shouldn't back these bills. Under no circumstances should that be the next step.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What former senator Scott Ludlam wrote in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span> today really summed it up:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the government is quite deliberately turning "national security" into a weapon with which to protect corporate interests and attack its opponents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They're former Senator Scott Ludlam's words, in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Guardian</span> today, and I recommend that senators read his full article. It really does unpack the bill and pinpoint what a serious stage we are at in this country—not dissimilar to the unravelling of democracy that we're seeing in a number of countries: England, Hungary, the US. Shocking things are happening, often in the name of democracy, often in the name of national security. But it's an overreach, and it's an overreach in the interests of a very narrow section of society: that section of society that the coalition government backs, that section of society that is committed to making profits. Why do they want to curtail civil society? Because they don't want to have to deal with protests and actions. They just want to get on and make their money and not have to worry about environmental standards or abiding by workplace safety measures, et cetera. They just want to be able to get on and do the job. I know somebody will probably come back and say all unions are exempt, but, the way industrial relations are going in this country, it's still damn hard for people to be able to get their voices heard.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is deeply shocking that Labor have gone along with these bills. They've abrogated their role as a party of opposition. They've abrogated their role in the Senate, where, clearly, we have a specific job to do: to look at these bills when they come before us. But it's been denied to all senators because of a deal stitched up as a way to fast-track this legislation as quickly as possible this week, and we're right in the midst of it now because the deal's in. They're trying to hang their hats on these 280 amendments. That's just an embarrassment, to try and make out that that's the solution here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The danger still lurks within these bills. Take the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill: the term 'foreign political organisation' is retained. This is a really big problem with this bill, and Labor senators—I'm sure some of them can see this—are not being honest if they're not bringing that forward in the debate and at least acknowledging that something needs to be done here, rather than just giving it a tick—'Oh, we got all our amendments. Everything's okay; just put it through. Foreign agents? Well, we really do want to grab foreign agents because they're bad people'—without looking at the definition of who we're capturing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The term, as I've said, is extremely broad and it's too ambiguous. This is where we can see how so many public interest not-for-profit groups that are not charities can be captured. This really goes to the essence of the major problem with what we're dealing with here. When I'm talking about groups that are public interest not-for-profits, I'm thinking of so many of the organisations that I work with: organisations that are refugee support groups doing extraordinary work, and activist groups in other countries. I'm about to go through a number of areas of work; it's a very rich part of our society. What it reminds you of is that, in this day and age, advocacy and protest actions are global. This lends madness to what we're dealing with here. It's madness from my point of view; it's a serious intent from the coalition government, because they do want to capture and silence the voices of so many of these groups.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Think of all those organisations here and in other countries that took action on the Trans-Pacific Partnership. That was a collaboration between a range of organisations—and sometimes even government groupings were involved as well—understanding the seriousness of that piece of so-called free trade legislation and that it had to be taken on, and this broad global alliance was built up. What happens to all those people in Australia? Do they have to then declare that they're foreign agents? Another recent one that comes to mind—we had a motion about this one—is the five-year anniversary of the tragic factory collapse in Bangladesh. Groups in Bangladesh and organisations here and in many other countries have worked together, highlighting the problems with the Bangladeshi government. There are all sorts of interactions going on there. Again, these are the sorts of people that can be covered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A very interesting one is cruel cosmetics. We have legislation before the parliament about that issue, about ending the testing of cosmetics and cosmetics ingredients on animals. The organisations that we're working with, Humane Society International and other groups, are working with governments and organisations around the world to advance these legal changes needed to outlaw cruel cosmetics in other countries. They'd be a cert to be captured by what's going on here, purely because of the very fine work they're doing. But, because of the loose term 'foreign political organisation', they could well be captured. The Great Barrier Reef is another one that, these days, is an issue that's being taken up by non-government organisations; many international organisations. At times, other governments are taking an interest in this. Again, the complexities here that this bill does not deal with are very serious, and the Senate needs to be very mindful of them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to just go back to some of the work of the Parliament Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. As I have said, the PJCIS recommendations did not satisfactorily address either the definition of 'political organisations' or the term 'acting on behalf of'. Again, I really want to give emphasis to this because if we can't deal with that then both these bills need to be rejected, because they go hand in hand. This matter is very serious, and this is what we need to take on board. Groups that are not registered charities may remain exposed under this bill because of the failure of these sections. I repeat again: that's because of the definition of 'foreign principle' and the treatment of 'acting on behalf of' in the legislation. 'Acting on behalf of' and 'foreign principle' are both key terms, because they remain problematically broad. Put simply, something has to be done about them. And we need to ensure that we accept amendments on those key areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that one of the recommendations has been to redefine the phrase 'foreign political organisation' to include only foreign political parties or organisations that field candidates in parliamentary elections. So there are proposals around, and Senator Nick McKim will bring those forward, as we do have amendments to move in this debate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But again, it has been so hard to grapple with the legislation, given the speed with which this has been rushed through. I again emphasise: there are 280 amendments to the legislation; we saw them only yesterday afternoon. That is a shocking way to deal with the situation before us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I congratulate my colleagues: Senator Richard Di Natale and Senator Nick McKim have really set out the major problems we have with this legislation. It should have gone to the Senate committee; it should not be rushed through. And amendments need to be made so that we ensure that this whole issue of foreign agents does not further cripple our civil society and our democratic practices.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="e5z" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SIEWERT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:17</span>):  I rise to also make a contribution on this package of bills, the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2017 and the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill 2017. These bills, I deeply believe, are an appalling crackdown on civil society and freedom of speech in this country. I'm particularly concerned about the impacts on civil society. Ever since I stepped foot in this place as a senator, I have been championing civil society and the role of charities and the not-for-profit sector in our democracy in this country, and I've been acting to protect their right to advocacy and their role in our democracy, because major changes in this country have nearly always been driven by civil society, with this place following where they lead. Their role is critical.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This package of bills is the latest move in a long line of steps that conservative governments have taken to stifle dissent, and the Turnbull government is continuing this approach. I have stood many times in this chamber to speak against proposals—which conservative governments have brought to this place and championed—to reduce the role of civil society and the role and capacity of charities and not-for-profits to advocate for change. It is all very well for this government to praise the role of charities and not-for-profits—for example, when they're tending to 'the poor'; when they are ministering to sections of our community. But woe betide them if they dare advocate for a change of policy which will make the lives of people better! That's not, apparently, what those on that side of the chamber want to see. Well the Greens will always stand up for the rights of charities and not-for-profits and civil society to do their work and to be able to advocate for change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Charities and not-for-profits have been under siege by Mr Turnbull, who's continued the work of previous conservative governments, and many of his glass-jawed MPs, who apparently don't like the spotlight focused on them. They don't like the fact that civil society speaks out about, and criticises, their policies. Sometimes they speak out in favour of them, but apparently government MPs don't like it when civil society is advocating for change. They clearly can't bear the facts of life of a democracy, that citizens have a right to scrutinise government policy and to advocate to improve it. Civil society is a critical part of our democracy. As I said, most of the change that has happened in our community has been led by civil society. They are the leaders; this place follows on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This series of bills—in fact, there's a three-pronged approach in this; there's a third bill, which we haven't debated yet and which I'll come to in a minute. We have this package of bills, but we also have the electoral reform bill, which sought to tie up charities and not-for-profits and civil society organisations in bureaucracy and red tape and cut off their sources of funding. We've also had the change, to tie up charities even further in red tape, that has already gone through this place—that is, the change to the way charities report some of their activities through the Electoral Act. They changed 'The purposes for the public expression of views on an issue in an election by any means', which is the area of the Electoral Act that requires charities and not-for-profits to report to the AEC, to:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The public expression of views on an issue that is, or is likely to be, before electors in an election (whether or not a writ has been issued for the election) by any means.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The AEC and the government say that doesn't change the reporting period, but it has caused mass confusion among charities and not-for-profits because how could they know whether an issue that they are talking about or advocating for is likely to be before electors in an election. How can you know?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During estimates I asked the AEC if they had put out the guidelines for how this should be interpreted, because it started from March. At that stage, they hadn't. Those guidelines are out now, and the feedback I get from community based organisations is it's still as clear as mud. The AEC said it doesn't change the reporting requirements. Well that is not the legal advice that some not-for-profits and charities have received. That change brings with it very significant penalties for charities and not-for-profits, particularly for their chief finance officers. So this government yet again, when they're supposed to be the mob that are reducing red tape, have further tied up our charities and not-for-profits in red tape with a view to stifling and silencing their comments. They're betting that charities and not-for-profits will be put off speaking out because they are concerned about that requirement, because they won't know if an issue that they talk about is likely to be before electors in an election. That is this government's attempt to clamp down on charities and not-for-profits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Right from the start it was clear that this electoral reform bill was not motivated by concerns about the influence of foreign money in Australia. If it were, why on earth didn't the government start in the most obvious place, which the Greens have been campaigning on for years—that is, putting caps on all donations to political parties and limiting expenditure to boot?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why didn't they start there? We've been advocating this for a long time. In fact, it was clearly designed to silence those in Civil Society who work every day to make this country better. The people and the groups who advocate for better services for the homeless or an end to Australia's cruel offshore prison camps are what this legislation was aimed at.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government drafted its electoral funding legislation to make sure that members of Australia's development community, for example, can't advocate for a decent foreign aid budget, when that budget has shrunk to its lowest levels ever. It wanted to make sure that environmental organisations can't campaign against massive dirty fossil fuel projects like Adani's Carmichael coalmine. The government seems to have put the electoral funding legislation on the backburner because of the hard work of campaigners in Civil Society. It's a shame they haven't put the other two bills in the same place. Instead of acknowledging that the Australian people have serious concerns about its entire foreign influence package, it is pushing ahead with the espionage and foreign influence transparency scheme bills—despite the fact that the legislation hasn't had enough scrutiny through this place. Not only is it proceeding but it's, in fact, attempting to ram it through the Senate without proper consultation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are bills that will change the way in which we conduct our democracy, yet they have only been through the secretive Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. The only parties that are on that committee are the coalition and the Labor Party. The rest of this chamber is excluded from that. This is extremely bad practice when we're talking about legislation like the espionage bill. George Williams was quoted in this chamber previously this morning. The dean of the University of New South Wales Faculty of Law and constitutional law expert sums up some of the concerns about the espionage bill well. On 11 June, Professor Williams wrote an opinion piece in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> and he said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Even with the changes of the parliamentary joint committee, the bill will remain incomplete and dangerous. It will contain overbroad and uncertain definitions of critical concepts such as national security—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Oops! I said the word 'security'. Take that out of the quote!</span>

                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:10.5pt;&#xD;&#xA;  " />The law also will undermine freedom of speech and of the press.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">As in past inquiries, the committee has given low weight to these values. It has failed to put forward amendments to prevent journalists being imprisoned ... The possibility also remains that people who publish information about Australia’s economic and political relations with other countries will face jail under new espionage offences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The espionage bill could criminalise activities like protesting in the streets to stop Australia declaring war on another country—something that, in fact, I have done myself—or to draw attention to possible breaches of humanitarian law by the Australian government. Peaceful and non-violent protestors at our detention centres might find themselves classified as saboteurs and subject to 20-year jail terms, according to legal advice obtained by Civil Society. Charities may have won a limited exemption from the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill so that they won't have to register as agents, but it's a hollow victory when other parts of the legislative package potentially criminalise public discourse on issues like food security, economic conditions and migration and refugee policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You might well ask: how can the government get away with this type of behaviour? How can it possibly rush this legislation that is so significant without proper scrutiny? Well, it's with the support of the opposition, with the support of the Labor Party. This is the same Labor Party that, last week, railed against the injustice of the government's undemocratic decision to gag and guillotine debate on the income tax cuts. And, while the Labor Party were in here this morning saying they wouldn't agree to gag and guillotine this debate, they are essentially doing that by siding with the government and ramming this through now, at this sitting, and failing to support the Greens in our attempt to refer these bills to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, where we could have scrutinised the 280 amendments that were made, virtually in the blink of an eye, in the House of Representatives yesterday. They have not been through adequate scrutiny. If this had gone to the legal and constitutional affairs committee, those amendments could have been scrutinised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the very same Labor Party that just a week ago said it supported the Hands Off Our Charities Red Line Principles. Those principles urged all MPs not to undermine our democracy or unduly constrain public-interest advocacy. Yet the moment the term 'national security' is bandied about they seem to lose all scruples. Now is the time for Labor to stand up for Australia's democracy. All it has done, so far, as my colleagues have pointed out, is sandpaper off the roughest edges of this legislation. Rather than continue its pattern of slavishly following the government in the name of bipartisanship on security, it should allow the Senate adequate time to consider this legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Rhiannon pointed out, there are other not-for-profit organisations that are still, potentially, caught up by this legislation. Not all of civil society is protected by the amendments that have been put forward. That is a disgrace in this country. We are a democracy. We need to do all we can to protect civil society. As my former colleague Scott Ludlam put it: with the opposition in this semi-comatose state, the wheels of democracy can still turn, but they are almost completely disengaged from what is really happening below the surface. This is about civil society. That is what I am deeply concerned about. I will always stand up to protect the role of civil society in our democracy. It is time that Labor woke up. They need to join with us to send this legislation off for proper review so that we can make an assessment as to whether the amendments that have been made to this legislation do what the committee recommended they do, to make sure they deliver what the committee recommended. How do we know? We don't—because we haven't had time to look at those amendments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that this legislation does not need to be passed before the winter break. We know that, given time, we can properly scrutinise this. And I would suggest it is highly likely that we would find some issues with those amendments if they were subject to proper scrutiny. The government's excuse of the upcoming by-elections—really?—has got to sound hollow to themselves. They must feel a little yucky when they use the by-elections as an excuse for this legislation. We need to draw a line in the sand, and we need to protect civil society and democracy in this country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to let people know that I will be moving second reading amendment 8476 once the Senate has dealt with my colleague Senator McKim's amendment. This legislation does not need to be rammed through this place. It should not be rammed through this place. It needs proper scrutiny because it has significant ramifications for democracy in this country. We need to stand up and protect our democracy, not ram this through right now with 280 amendments that we haven't had time to scrutinise properly. We will give it a red-hot shot in this chamber, when we are in Committee of the Whole, to ask the government questions and to look at these amendments. But we can't possibly do the same job in the Committee of the Whole that we could do if we were to subject this to a public inquiry through the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, where we could hear from experts like Professor Williams and a whole range of others who are taking an interest in this legislation. We did not get an opportunity to hear from them before these amendments came before us to be debated.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:36</span>):  I rise to speak on the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2018 and the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill 2017. While it's true that the bills have been available since late last year, we are now considering something quite significantly different, and I find myself in the difficult position of not having had sufficient opportunity to gain a full understanding of what we are considering. It was only yesterday—24 hours ago—that I actually had a copy of what we are considering today. That's because what we are considering incorporates amendments that arise from the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. Those recommendations, and the implementation of those recommendations, have transformed the bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The scope of the bills has been reduced considerably, and a range of precautions and safeguards have been introduced. This is a good thing, and I admit that I am far less alarmed by the bills than I was when they were first introduced. I am still alarmed, though, by the fact that the bills were so 'over the top' when they were introduced and required the PJCIS to pare them back to something that's not totally inconsistent with a liberal democracy. It's as if the original bills were an ambit claim by the security agencies and the Attorney-General's Department.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It alarms me that we have people in our bureaucracy who think it is okay to require registration as a foreign agent of tens of thousands of Australians—probably hundreds of thousands—including members and senators. On what planet do such people exist? Somehow, these people came to the conclusion that our democracy would be served by requiring the registration of members and senators as foreign agents, because they represented a foreign point of view from time to time—advocating for a free trade agreement with the EU or the UK, for example, or advocating for Australia to leave or remain in the United Nations Human Rights Council. Under the original bill, the foreign minister and the shadow foreign minister would have done nothing but fill in forms—and, of course, they would have had to have paid a fee for the privilege. Frankly, I think the people responsible for the original bill should be purged from the Public Service and sent to count pencils and paperclips. They are a threat to our way of life. Thank goodness the PJCIS has done its job and got rid of most of that nonsense. Just imagine if it hadn't. But the question is: did it get them all? Did it find all the landmines—all the infringements on free speech and on the rights of Australians to advocate for their causes, to speak to people in other countries and to push the case for other countries?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I doubt very much that it did.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will give one example, but I note, in giving this example, I've only had 24 hours to find examples and to examine the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2017.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The important point is that there is no definition of 'supervised'. In the same sentence in the same part there is also 'directed'. Clearly 'supervised' is not intended to be the same as 'directed'. What does 'supervised' mean? There is no definition in the bill or the act that it's amending. We have to assume that a court would apply its natural meaning. But what is that?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have no definition in the bill or the act that it's amending for 'covert'. We don't know what that means either. Again, a court would have to apply what it thinks is its natural meaning. Examples of 'covert' might be the use of WhatsApp, which is an encrypted messaging service. Because WhatsApp is being used by half of the parliament, a court might say, 'No, that's not covert, but Telegram is.' Telegram is not being used by so many, and, in Telegram the messages erase themselves after a little while—you can set how long that is. Is that 'covert'?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are three examples that I can think of that could well and truly fall foul of that provision. The Vatican is a foreign power. Catholic priests are undoubtedly directed by, if not supervised by, the Vatican. Canon law governs their life. Canon law originates in the Vatican. If a priest here in Australia is lobbying the government and advocating for the government to adopt a particular position on something as controversial as assisted suicide or something less controversial as same-sex marriage or the redress scheme for the child abuse cases, does that run foul of the law?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another example might be advocating a free trade agreement with Taiwan. Taiwan is a free, democratic society. We have a free trade agreement with China, which isn't a free, democratic society. In advocating for a free trade agreement with Taiwan, would it be supervised and would it be directed? You might potentially envisage going to the Taiwanese embassy and saying, 'How would you like me to approach this? What is going to maximise the chances of it being a success? What have you said that I can say that would complement that?' Would that amount to being directed? What if you communicated in a fashion such as via WhatsApp or Telegram? I think that would satisfy all of the criteria.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A case that I have raised in estimates is about Australia's foreign aid to Palestinian territories and whether that aid ends up assisting Hamas. You could easily envisage a situation where you might liaise with representatives from the Israeli government to ensure that you're not cutting across something that they're already saying and that you're not contradicting information that they've put out. Does that contravene this provision? I note that, if you do contravene this provision, the offence carries a penalty of 20 years imprisonment. We should not be in a situation where that sword—that degree of risk—depends on a definition of 'supervised' or 'covert'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm confident that that issue—and almost certainly others that I haven't found yet—would be discovered in an inquiry by the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. As it stands, we will have to fix this bill up later, as we have done for other national security legislation. The bills have aspects in them that I can support. But, given that I haven't had time to properly consider them, I have no option but to vote against them.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="YW4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator IAN MACDONALD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:45</span>):  The coalition government—first, of Mr Abbott, and, now, of Mr Turnbull—has done a magnificent job in developing northern Australia. And it's something we are committed to doing. The northern Australia development white paper launched a few years ago set out a blueprint for the development of the north.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To help with the development of the north, we've had some very good advocates. I mention my colleague the Hon. Warren Entsch, the member for Leichhardt, who is a great and passionate advocate for northern Australia and chairs the Joint Standing Committee on Northern Australia. George Christensen, the member for Dawson, is also passionate about the north and has worked very, very hard to ensure that the development of all northern Australia actually happens. I want to also mention Melissa Price, the member for Durack, who looks after the northern part of Western Australia—again, a passionate advocate, a passionate worker, for the development of all parts of northern Australia. And I give a shout-out to Natasha Griggs, who was the member for the Northern Territory seat of Solomon when the northern Australia white paper came into being.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Queensland, George Christensen, Warren Entsch and I, based in Townsville, have worked for the north. Unfortunately, in recent years, there have been two members of parliament who have been not doing a skerrick to help the development of northern Australia. One is the member for Herbert, whose sole contribution to developing northern Australia seems to be to criticise everything that the government does. She doesn't criticise, of course, when the Queensland Labor government blocks a substantial investment in northern Australia for no reason other than crass political purposes. And generally, from talking to ministers, I don't think the member for Herbert has ever made one serious approach to any minister about anything in Townsville. The other laggard, you might say, in the north is the member for Kennedy, who—whilst he's pretty good at doing stunts and getting front pages about odd sorts of things—has done nothing to assist in the development of the great north-west of Queensland. I've been pleased to fill in as the real member for that area. And, together with the leaders of the communities in Kennedy, we've done a lot.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I now have some very good news for northern Australians—particularly those who live in the electorates of Herbert and Kennedy—because, just last weekend, the LNP selected candidates for both seats. I want to particularly welcome, first of all, Phillip Thompson, a distinguished former serving soldier in the Townsville based 1st Battalion Royal Australian Regiment, which has the core values of protecting the Australian way of life, freedom of speech, family and reward for effort. They were all characteristics he fought for. And it's fortunate that Senator Payne is in the office of defence minister. She will be looking forward to getting someone into this parliament who not only understands the defence aspects but also will contribute to all aspects of life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Phillip Thompson, whilst serving in 2009 in Afghanistan, was wounded in action when an IED detonated within a metre of him. The blast resulted in him sustaining severe injuries. He was medically evacuated back to Australia. He says, 'The road to recovery and post-traumatic growth was a steep and often difficult climb, but I'm proud of my recovery and the man I am today, and I've spent the past six years dedicating my life to helping others find their resilience within so they can live a full and meaningful life.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For his work with mental health in Townsville, he was awarded the Queensland Young Australian of the Year this year. He is a married man, with a young bub—not very old. He's married to a Palm Island woman. He will be a formidable voice for northern Australia and North Queensland. I wish him all the very best. He is the sort of person who's already served their nation, and he's looking forward to serving it again in a different capacity. I know he will do very well. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to move on to the electorate of Kennedy, where the LNP again, in its wisdom, has selected Frank Beveridge as the candidate for Kennedy. Frank is well known in the Kennedy electorate because he was on the Charters Towers Regional Council for a number of years and was mayor from 2012 to 2016. He'd previously served on that council for 12 years as a councillor. I well know Frank Beveridge in his role in the council. He was always at my doorstep pushing for things for the Charters Towers end of that electorate. I still remember his advocacy for, I think it was called, the black rock weir on the Burdekin River. That's something I know Frank is passionate about. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He and his wife Sharon have been married for 32 years. They have four adult children and one grandchild. He's lived in Charters Towers for 40 years, and he's been a small-business owner for 30 years. He's a well-known figure in all parts of the electorate of Kennedy. He's recently taken on the job as chairman of Regional Development Australia, which looks after the north and north-western parts of Australia. He has very significant experience in helping the community to campaign and raise funds for community organisations and causes. Frank, I'm delighted to say, will be carrying the banner and offering to the people of that vast seat of Kennedy a real alternative. He is someone who will get out and advocate their causes and do something serious for those areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For those of you who don't know, the electorate of Kennedy was always seen as a western Queensland seat. If you talk Kennedy you think of Mount Isa, Cloncurry, Burketown, McKinlay Shire, Richmond and Hughenden. But, these days, the electorate of Kennedy is more based on the coast. The northern suburbs, new suburbs, aspirational suburbs of Townsville at what's called the North Shore, are now a significant part of the electorate of Kennedy. Going further north, the southern suburbs—again, you might call them the aspirational suburbs—of Cairns are a very big part of the electorate of Kennedy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kennedy includes the wonderful sugar towns of Ingham, Innisfail and Tully, the tourist meccas of Cardwell and Mission Beach, and the Atherton Tableland, just west of Cairns, with all its significant potential. It's not only potential. They're actually doing it on the Atherton Tableland—the Tinaroo Dam and the Nallinga Dam, which the coalition government is committed to. They will continue to allow that area to be the food bowl for northern Queensland and, indeed, a very big export hub for the north. Kennedy also takes in the gulf area, one of the biggest and best beef cattle areas. I know Frank Beveridge will be supportive of free trade agreements, because the current member opposes them. The biggest beneficiaries of the recent free trade agreements, particularly the Trans-Pacific Partnership, are the sugar industry and the beef industry, two of the biggest industries in the electrode of Kennedy—yet the current member opposes them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I look forward to welcoming both of these people into this parliament after the next election. They're both persons who have significant history, a significant record of achievement and commitment, and I am certain that they will make not only wonderful members in this parliament but wonderful representatives for their respective communities. I look forward very much to welcoming them to Canberra.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="204953" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GALLACHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:55</span>):  I would like to make a contribution in senators' statements about a very important issue which often goes unremarked and unaddressed in this federal arena.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just to start off, I attended the RAP program—the Road Awareness Program—run by the South Australian Metropolitan Fire Service. It was absolutely inspiring to see the work that the firefighters are doing. I know, Mr Acting Deputy President Marshall, that you have some knowledge of the firefighting services and what they contribute around the great country that we live in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The South Australian Metropolitan Fire Service go out to schools in regional, rural and metropolitan South Australia and they talk to P-platers, learners, and young aspiring drivers about the great risks that come with the awful responsibility of having a licence in Australia. There's probably no more evidence of the great wealth of this country than most of our young kids aspiring to a learner's permit, a provisional licence and the independence and freedom of movement that the motor vehicle gives them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there are enormous consequences for a moment of inattention. One of the contributors in the RAP program—a young man called Yudhi Mohan-Ram—is now in the 15th year of recovery from a moment of inattention by a P-plater. Basically, in a moment of inattention, a P-plater T-boned him on a motorcycle, setting off catastrophic injuries which took months and months of being in a coma. He had broken legs, broken ribs and every organ in his body was bruised. But in the spirit that this young man has, he now spends his volunteering time addressing young children about the responsibilities they have when they do get their licence and partake of the great independence and freedom that motor vehicles give us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a remarkable story. Mr Glenn Smith from the Metropolitan Fire Service is also another remarkable contributor. Part of his daily job is to go and secure the perimeter of an accident, then secure the immediate vicinity of the accident and then use the jaws of life or whatever tools are required to take victims and people out of accidents. It's part of the service's daily job, but they want to do less of that. That's why they go into schools and that's why they present this great program to young adults who are going to take that next step into driving and the independence and freedom that motor vehicles give them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an absolutely inspiring program, and I'm sure that if anyone in South Australia gets the opportunity, they could go along and witness it in action. It's a continual effort, supported by the Motor Accident Commission of South Australia, the South Australian Metropolitan Fire Service, the government of South Australia, SA Power Networks, the RAA, Our Family Helping Yours and the Australian Professional Firefighters Foundation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just wanted to get that completely on the record before I go to what I think is missing in this debate: from 2007 to 2017, we've had 14,275 Australians killed on our roads—14,275 in a 10-year period. We did have a proper ongoing target of reducing deaths and injuries by 30 per cent, but we're not making that target. By 2020, we should have reduced deaths and injuries by 30 per cent. We've reduced them by 14 per cent, so we're 16 per cent short.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a chamber of political debate, so let's just go to see where the responsibilities lie for this inaction. I contend that the federal parliament has responsibility in a number of areas and I'm going to put a few of those on the record. Better roads will boost productivity and improve road safety, and we could get the Roads to Recovery and Black Spot programs expended. There's the support for the Keys2drive program. There's the better approach to cycling safety and a review into the economic and social costs of road trauma. There's the encouragement of purchasing safer cars, and tasking the Department of Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities with examining whether it is appropriate to stop the importation of cars with less than four-star Australasian New Car Assessment Program ratings by 2016. It is now July 2018, or it was the last I looked. There needs to be greater collaboration and better communication and working with motoring and motorcycle organisations. There's increased cooperation through the Council of Australian Governments. There's support for successful state based programs to encourage safer driving.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of that is the other side's, the coalition's, road safety policy. If we were to go back and see which of those road safety policies have been acted upon—this is the 2013 policy of the coalition, supported by the ALP and, I presume, every other stakeholder in this chamber because road safety is a bipartisan issue—what have we seen in that space? Who do we talk to about it? Would it be the Hon. Michael McCormack, the incumbent? Would it be the Hon. John McVeigh? Would we have to go back and ask the Hon. Warren Truss, the Hon. Darren Chester or the Hon. Barnaby Joyce? Or maybe we have to go back and ask the Hon. Jamie Briggs? They've all been in ministerial positions holding responsibility for policy in this area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We'd have to say, given that we're nowhere near our target of 30 per cent reductions by 2020—in fact, we have a very short period of time to get a 16 per cent improvement—that the coalition policy has failed. If I was to go into estimates and ask, 'Who is responsible for road safety?' it wouldn't be abundantly clear. What if I asked the bureaucrats: 'Who is working on 5G? Who's working on intelligent intersections? Who's working on intelligent cars? Who's working on autonomous cars, electric cars? Who's going to put all of this great efficiency that will come into our road network together for the benefit of the economy?'</span>

                  </a>  I take that interjection, Senator Farrell. It is extremely clear that coherent policy, probably bipartisan policy—not bipartisan, but multipartisan policy—that is easy and achievable has not been acted upon by a succession of ministers, not acted on by a complete section of ministers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I go to estimates and ask the questions, I dare say the department is quite embarrassed about this. You do need direction. The policy's great, but you need a minister to give the direction to the department that they need to act upon. You do need a clear, identifiable pathway. Yudhi Mohan-Ram is a lucky person—he's alive. He's had 15 years of injury; 15 years he's been out there. The spirit he has to give back to the community of road safety is really rewarding, especially when you see him in operation with young children, just trying to make them aware that one moment of inattention can have a lifetime of consequences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know this; this is bread and butter stuff. There's no debate between us, but why, with great policy in 2013, is it that the inaction of that side of the chamber is clear and evident? It must stop; 14,275 lives ended. It needs to stop now. The government needs to be clear in its definition of who is going to be the road safety champion on that side of the chamber. They need to announce it; they need to push it out and get it done. There will be a road safety conference at the end of this year in Sydney. Dare I say it, the minister will turn up and then he'll turn up at the next one next year. We need someone working on this every day, because every day in Australia people are getting killed or seriously injured on our roads, and it affects an enormous number of people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Mohan-Ram has done a little bit of research. He worked for a company that employed 1,000 people. Everybody in that company knew that he'd been tragically and catastrophically injured. He has 38 first cousins; they all knew. His wife and 18-month-old daughter drove past the accident scene; they knew. If we can do anything to stop or reduce this, then this parliament should be united in its application and dedication to make our roads much safer. It's within our ability to do it. Dare I say it, 2013 policy is tremendously relevant today. All of those things are still relevant; they just simply need to be acted upon. The government should immediately put in place someone to act as a road safety champion for this country.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKIM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:05</span>):  Something is deeply wrong in the state of Tasmania. Our precious places, our wilderness, our Crown land, our national parks and our World Heritage area are being locked up, packaged up and sold like trinkets by the Liberal government to the highest corporate bidder. Our wilderness is precious and our Crown lands are precious, as are our national parks and our World Heritage area. Our coastlines, our mountains, our rivers and our forests belong to all of us, and, in the case of the World Heritage area, we hold them in trust for all the people of the world. They're held in trust not only for the people of today, for the people of our state, but for our children and grandchildren. We have a moral obligation to look after them and hand them on intact, with their wilderness values, their natural values, their cultural heritage values and their public access preserved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They do not belong to the Liberal Party. They do not belong to Will Hodgman, the Premier of Tasmania, who, in a massive conflict of interest, has taken on the portfolios of parks and tourism at the same time. They do not belong to the corporate mates of the Tasmanian Liberal Party or their corporate donors. Tasmania and our precious places are not theirs to sell. But, at the moment, they're up for sale. In fact, some have already been sold off. They've carved up parts of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area and set them aside for exclusive private development, locking the Tasmanian people out of the World Heritage area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They've used dodgy mechanisms, like the dodgy rezoning to allow for a development at Lake Malbena to go ahead. The original draft management plan would have prohibited the development that is now proposed there; but, when the final plan came out, the boundaries were magically moved, and now that development is able, potentially, to proceed. We will fight that one all the way and, in doing so, we'll stand not only with the conservation movement and Tasmanians who are concerned about privatising our precious places and a lack of public access but also with the fly-fishing community in Tasmania, who value Lake Malbena and its surrounding areas as one of the great fly-fishing territories in the world. They don't want to see it ruined by multiple helicopter flights on a regular basis and a private development that will create an exclusivity where, currently, there is public access.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They want to put a massive cable car on kunanyi/Mount Wellington, which is supported by the Liberal and Labor parties in Tasmania. They want to build another privately-run cable car inside the Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park. There have been multiple developments approved under a dodgy, secretive process, and special favours given to privatise public land under an expressions-of-interest process run by the Coordinator-General, who, this week in budget estimates in the Tasmanian parliament, refused to say which areas of Crown land are on the chopping block and even refused to answer questions about how much Crown land in total is at risk of being privatised and the public locked out from.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once you get past the greenwashing that the government is engaged in, the massive number of private corporate developments that have been proposed in our wilderness, in our national parks, on our Crown land and in our World Heritage Area amounts to a selling off of some of the most precious parts of our state. Of course, some of the most precious parts of our state are also some of the most precious parts of our planet. In the case of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage area, we hold that in trust for every single person on this planet and for future generations. The Liberal government, under Will Hodgman, knows the price of everything but the value of nothing. They don't understand value unless they can put a dollar figure on it. And the only way they are interested in putting a dollar figure on it as if one of their corporate mates—and, in many cases, their corporate donors—approaches them with a secret proposal to develop on our coastline, in our forests, on our rivers and in our highlands.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is happening in Tasmania is a microcosm of what is happening around the country and in many parts of the world. This is fundamentally the problem Western democracies are facing right now: politicians are giving away power to corporate boardrooms. In doing so, they are disenfranchising the people they are supposed to represent in parliaments like this one and the Tasmanian parliament. We are seeing corporate donations flow in and we are seeing outcomes flow from the politicians to their corporate mates who donate so generously because they know it buys them outcomes. What is the result of this? The result is the two great problems facing our planet and humanity and, in particular, Western liberal democracies. The first is environmental degradation and damage, and part of that, obviously, is the greatest crisis in public policy facing humanity, which is climate change. The second part—and these are two sides of the same problematic coin—is people being thrown on the scrapheap and the massive economic inequality which exists and is growing in most Western liberal democracies around the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Politicians are giving Tasmania away, effectively for nothing. In doing so, they are locking Tasmanians out of what should be the Tasmanian people's place. What should be owned by the many and able to be accessed by the many is being handed over, yet again, to the wealthy few. We have seen it time after time after time. Have a look at the Cambria Green proposal for Tasmania's east coast—effectively a new town between Swansea and Bicheno that will house over 3,000 people. The locals, rightly and understandably, are up in arms against it. But the old parties can't see past the dollar signs in their eyes. Look at the land in the north-west of Tasmania formerly owned by the Van Diemen's Land Company—some of the most historic land in Tasmania. It is a place where there was indisputably an attempted genocide, run by Van Diemen's Land Company, against the Tasmanian Aboriginal people who lived in the area. It has now been bought by a Chinese company with a loan from the Bank of China, which is wholly owned by the Chinese government. So if there is a default on that loan—and the company, believe you me, is massively struggling financially—that beautiful, historic part of Tasmania, the habitat of Tasmanian devils, that spectacular coastline with threatened species, will be owned, lock, stock and barrel, by the Chinese government. We have been talking about foreign influence in this place this morning, but let's have a look at foreign interests purchasing Tasmania, effectively for nothing—sold off by the Liberals, who know, as I said, the dollar price of everything and the value of nothing. There is a better way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have stood up for Tasmania's wild places for a century, and we will continue to do it. We'll always defend Tasmania—the place and our people. We'll stand up for the Tasmanian people's capacity to access some of our most precious places. We will stop the sell-off and we will work to keep our wild places wild. Our forests, rivers, mountains, national parks and world heritage area have to remain in public hands with public access. I say to the Tasmanian people: we will stand with you against this sell-off.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="250216" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator REYNOLDS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:15</span>):  This afternoon I rise to express my pride in being a member of the WA Liberal Party. I send my most heartfelt congratulations to our candidate and now member for Darling Range, Alyssa Hayden, all of our opposition team and in particular the leader, Mike Nahan, and also all of the men and women of the WA Liberal Party. I just want to say how proud I am of the team. It is our team at its absolute best. I'm proud of the way that we campaigned and the way we won that seat.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No Western Australian should be under any misapprehension of what that result means. The Darling Range by-election was clearly a referendum on the performance of the McGowan government. The people of Western Australia should never, ever be taken for granted and treated as fools. On all measures, this is what the WA state government have done to the people of Western Australia. We said at the time, and we still say today, that the state Labor government had a plan to win the election, whatever it took, but they did not have a plan to govern for our state. At the election, they promised no new taxes, but instead we got an Uber tax and a gambling tax and they tried to inflict a gold tax, and utility charges are going up and up. They also promised no privatisation, after campaigning viciously against the Barnett government's proposal to sell Western Power. Guess what they did? They've already sold off a portion of Synergy to a foreign investor. They promised mandatory minimum sentencing for meth dealers, yet introduced legislation without those provisions—surprise, surprise. They promised a wage increase for all Western Australian police of 1.5 per cent. Surprise, surprise: they failed to deliver that and, instead, offered $1,000 a year per police officer. Also, they've walked away from many of their signature policies, including medihotels and specialised drug treatment centres in the South West and the Kimberley, and they haven't budgeted for the promised hospital upgrades. The list goes on and on. It's a long list of broken promises in only 15 months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So make no mistake about the Darling Range result. The Labor candidate's missteps in the campaign had very little to do with the result, despite the fact that it was the way that the Premier was trying to spin it on election night. It was simply about their abysmal governance of our state. Despite all of their spin, a nine per cent swing cannot be dismissed by the Labor Party and it should not be dismissed. Rather than the spin that it wasn't really their fault and that it had nothing to do with them, it was all about their dodgy candidates and their MP. So I thought I would share the facts with my colleagues here. These are the facts, not the spin. Since the Liberal Party was formed in 1945, there have been 69 by-elections in Western Australia. Of those, only 11 have resulted in a change of party representation in those seats—11 out of 69 by-elections since 1945. There were only three previous occasions when the opposition took a seat from the government of the day. I can say that Alyssa Hayden is now in very, very good company. Of those three, the first was when Sir David Brand took Greenough from a four-term Labor government in 1945. That was the first victory for the newly formed Liberal Party in the nation. The second occasion was when the Liberals took Bunbury in 1955 from an ALP government two years into its term, with a swing of 3.7 per cent. The third and last one, until this weekend, was when the Liberals won Geraldton in 1991, when the ALP's primary vote collapsed to 30 per cent. So from the Liberal Party's first victory in 1945 with Sir David Brand to 1955 and 1991 and now to Alyssa Hayden, you are, as I said, in very esteemed and very good company.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What does this show us? Aside from showing that only Liberals can win a seat from an incumbent Labor government, a swing of 9.1 against a first-term Labor government is extraordinary, and it is unprecedented. This election was the first opportunity for Western Australians to send a very clear message to the Labor government that they are clearly failing our state. They're failing in so many ways. They're failing when it comes to diversifying the economy. It's something they talk about all the time, but, again, they have no vision and no action plan to deliver that vision for our state. When it comes to developing a strong state economy and enabling the delivery of services to Western Australians and funding those services that we expect and deserve, they have no plan. When it comes to making the cost of living sustainable, they have no plan. In fact, not only do they not have a plan to ease the burden of costs on working families in Western Australia but in the last 12 months alone—again, as a broken promise—they have increased household bills; they have increased water bills, power bills and car registration bills for the average WA family by $700 all in all, and they've already announced another $500 of increased household bills for Western Australian families. That is utterly shameful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The McGowan government are making cuts to the Western Australia Police Force. They're sending our state on the same sad trajectory that Victoria is now on. And when it comes to giving our kids a first class education, those on the opposite side of this chamber talk all the time about education. But, despite promising to increase education spending in Western Australia—guess what?—they've actually cut it by over $285 million, another broken promise. They've cut education expenditure. The former Liberal education minister, Peter Collier, stood up against these savage cuts that were proposed by the bureaucracy at the time. He said: 'No. We will actually increase expenditure to schools, not decrease it.' But the current state education minister, Sue Ellery, did not have the same courage of conviction or support of her premier, and they cut.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this place a few weeks ago I spoke about the shocking treatment and closure of Moora College for the want of $500,000 expenditure to upgrade that college and to keep residential facility in our state, which is so important for those students, for their families and for their community. Guess what? I gave that speech, and instead of saying, 'Yes, you've kind of got a point; we really should find the $500,000 to keep that college open,' I got a four-page missive from Sue Ellery saying that it was a justified decision. I would love to be able to share all four pages of this missive with the chamber, because it was a complete and utter disgrace. But I will give just a couple of highlights. They've cut $285 million from the state education budget, but she had the hide in this letter to say that the Labor government had allocated $235 million extra to school programs across the state. I thought: well, that's very interesting mathematics; where does the money actually come from? What she left out is that nearly 70 per cent of that expenditure had been committed by the Barnett government and was already in the forward estimates. These are some of the things she had the cheek to claim as Labor achievements: stage 2 of building works for Cape Naturaliste College, which was in fact funded by the Barnett Labor government; the final stage of Carnarvon Community College, which was commenced and funded by the Barnett government; and building works for Geraldton Senior College, John Willcock College, Wandina Primary School and Kalgoorlie-Boulder Community High School, which—guess what?—she was claiming as Labor expenditure, but it was funded by the Barnett government. It's absolutely shameless, what we've seen over the last 12 months of this terrible government. Just turning up and cutting ribbons on Liberal projects does not make them Labor projects.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the short bit of time I have left I'd like to again sincerely congratulate our wonderful candidate and now MP, Alyssa Hayden, and the entire WA Liberal team. Senator Dean Smith and I were both out on the booths on the day, and there was a wonderful sense of community and spirit among our candidates and all our supporters.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to finish on the words of the great Sir Robert Menzies and a campaign speech he gave in 1961 on the difference between Liberals and Labor—and it is still valid today. This is what he said about the Liberals:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We offer you good government. The essential quality of good government is that it should have sound and intelligible principles, that it should pursue great national and social objectives with resoluteness, that it should be able to meet the storms that arise from time to time with a proper sense of navigation, that it should have cohesion in its own ranks and a strong sense of mutual loyalty.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">And it is not based on promises that can never be delivered. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="112096" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator LINES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy President and Chair of Committees</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:25</span>):  I rise today to report further on the fabulous First Nations Women's Forum that my office facilitated in March this year to enable First Nations women to have a very clear input into Labor policy. The Labor Party is going through its policy process at the moment, which will culminate in our conference at the end of this year. We brought together First Nations women from across the country. I would like to sincerely thank the steering group of the First Nations women for the role they took in developing the day, making it a safe space for women to speak, for contributing and determining all of the topics and for participating in the writing of the report, which will be finalised fairly soon. I would invite anyone in this chamber or anyone listening who would like a copy of the report when it's published to contact my office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to thank Dot Bagshaw, Dorinda Cox, Vanessa Elliott, Jennifer Gregory-Kniveton, Marian Kickett, Rowena Leslie, Dr Hannah McGlade, Michelle Nelson-Cox, Donna Nelson, Jackie Oakley and Cherie Sibosado. We started this consultation with a welcome to country and a smoking ceremony, which we held up in Beedawong, in the beautiful Kings Park. That was an unforgettable experience, and I would like to thank, once again, Mingli McGlade, Liz Hayden, Alice Kearing and her daughters and Mungart Yongah Nyoongah Arts Enterprise—and, again, particular thanks to Hannah McGlade for organising that amazing day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From the Labor side, we invited our deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek, MP Linda Burney and Senator Malarndirri McCarthy to come to the welcome, the healing ceremony and the actual day. It was a very hot afternoon, but King's Park still allowed us to do a smoking ceremony. The women made us take our shoes off and get the dirt in our feet. It was a truly moving experience for everyone who attended, and I'm very honoured to have participated. We would like to thank the Botanic Gardens and Parks Authority for allowing that to occur and we thank the fabulous Subiaco Arts Centre, who gave us their premises and their staff for free, which enabled us to hold the day there and to be ably assisted by their staff to make the day such a success.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had more than 100 women attend—about 150, I think—and they travelled from all parts of the state. Obviously that cost money. For their generous contributions to enable the day to go ahead, I want to thank: the WA Labor Party; United Voice; Yara Pilbara; Herbert Smith Freehills; Maurice Blackburn; Senator Patrick Dodson; Senator Louise Pratt; Anne Aly, the member for Cowan; Josh Wilson, who was at that time the member for Fremantle and is now Labor's candidate in the by-election; and the former member for Perth, Tim Hammond. Some of the women from Kalgoorlie, Kununurra and the Pilbara had other organisations support their involvement. I'd also like to thank WA Minister Simone McGurk, who came along to hear what the women said, and Louise Pratt and Madeleine King, who participated, along with me, on the day. This was an opportunity for Labor MPs to hear and listen to what the women were telling us. The topics covered were children, youth and learning; health and ageing; human rights; treaty and constitutional recognition; social and emotional wellbeing; and effective programs and policies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to pay my respects to and thank Gningala Yarran-Mark for her contribution as an MC. She is an outstanding First Nations woman in our community, a learned scholar, an amazing woman—and, I have to say, a brilliant MC, who brings warmth, empathy and comedy to the role.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So what did the women tell us that they wanted? They were very clear. And certainly the forum was designed so that we would listen to the ideas and the views expressed from First Nations women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the topic of children, youth and learning, we covered a range of different topics, including parenting, child removal, school participation and the importance of Aboriginal languages. One of the key things that came out was that, obviously, like all of us, First Nations women want their children to be successful at school, but school needs to be more welcoming. First Nations women want to have a place on boards, and they want programs that really facilitate the involvement of First Nations families in our education system. In the past, those programs have been cut; they want them to be put back in place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On health and ageing, the women discussed holistic and preventive care, aged care, the National Disability Insurance Scheme and the cashless debit card. It should be acknowledged that First Nations women tend to experience pressure to assume the bulk of the responsibility for holding their families and communities together. In times of crisis, they often neglect their own health and wellbeing needs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They certainly want an ongoing consultative process right across Australia, including in the states and territories, that gives community based First Nations women an opportunity to have their voices heard. That was very clear in some of the responses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the cashless debit card and the BasicsCard, they feel that those are a violation of civil rights. Further, the women did not accept the rationale for their implementation—namely, high levels of child neglect and abuse. Community engagement by relevant statutory agencies was likely to produce better outcomes than dictating how welfare-payment recipients use their limited income.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The issues raised around aged care were these. Their experience of aged-care facilities is pretty poor. They want to see the use of traditional medicines and the embracing of Aboriginal healers much more prominent in the aged-care services in our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The women spoke strongly about a human rights treaty and constitutional recognition. And no-one in this place should be surprised to hear that a treaty was the No. 1 agenda item.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="122087" type="MemberInterjecting">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">Senator McCarthy:</span>
                  </a>  Hear, hear!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="112096" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator LINES:</span>
                  </a>  Yes, I'm talking about our First Nations forum, Senator McCarthy. They want to see a treaty front and centre of what should happen across this nation. They talked about the issue of a treaty and of the fact that cultural healing is really important and of the establishment of a makarrata commission. And their voices joined other voices that we've heard on the need for a treaty across this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On social and emotional wellbeing, they identified gaps in services for First Nations people and the necessity of ongoing dialogue between community and all levels of government. Funding for culturally appropriate health centres and refugees were among the topics of discussion as to social and emotional wellbeing. They wanted to see a First-Nations-led review of services to be conducted to identify funding, geographical or sectoral gaps in services. They acknowledge that social support workers, who have knowledge of but are independent of the system, are needed to provide advice for First Nations people to navigate services. They talked about cultural competency—the need for organisations to be aware of issues and of how to engage with First Nations people, but they certainly wanted to see First Nations people front and centre of service delivery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, it was an amazing day. We are at the point of producing our final document. I'd like to thank the wonderful women in my own office and, in particular, Clare Davidson, who led this whole engagement and has taken responsibility—along with our steering committee—for putting this report together. We do need to listen to First Nations voices—particularly the voices of women. As I said, this report will be concluded shortly. It will be available publicly, and I would urge anyone who would like a copy to talk to my office.</span>

Not a one-sided, shrill debate or a pejorative slamming of people with different points of view, but a careful analysis of how immigration is playing with our economic, our social and our cultural interests. No-one is denying or is in any doubt that immigration has played a vital role in Australia's history. It's been talked about very often that we are a migrant nation, and we will continue to be so. I shut down entirely the people who say we should have zero immigration or we should be limiting the content of our migrant intake according to people's skin colour or according to their cultural background or anything else. But what we do need to do is to make sure immigration is working towards our economic interests, towards our social interests and towards our cultural interests. And until we can have a sensible and reasoned discussion about it, we're never going to be able to achieve those aims.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will deal with the economic equation for a moment. Governments love big migration policies. They love them because you have more people coming into a particular country and they're going to consume more things—they're going to buy things from business, they're going to require services, they're going to require physical goods and commodities—and that grows GDP, the gross domestic product, which is the economy. But that growth does actually come at the expense of personal economic wellbeing or family economic wellbeing, and that's why the Australian people think immigration is far too high. They're seeing it firsthand: the constrictions and restrictions on their ability to get some jobs, on their ability to commute in a reasonable manner, on the provision of infrastructure, on the economic wellbeing that they experience.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you look at it on a per capita basis, Australians are going backwards when it comes to per capita income. So, while the economy's growing because you've got more people coming here, it's actually having a detrimental effect for the average Aussie. That's not sustainable. We need to make sure that our immigration intake is working towards the benefit of the average Aussie. We need to make sure the governments of state and federal persuasions can keep up with the growing demands that a growing population is placing upon them to provide services and goods, as well as the infrastructure that's necessary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then you can have a look at the social context. There are many who will deny it, but there is no doubt that there are pockets of immigrants where law and order issues are decisively built around these communities. In Victoria, people often talk about the African gang problems. That's how they're generalised; I don't know the specifics of which African nations they're from, but that's what they talk about. People are genuinely living in fear of the conduct of some of these people. Part of that reason, which I'll come back to later, relates to the opportunities that are available to them. In the meantime, we can make decisions about whether we're going to add to these problems, or whether we don't. The Australian people are demanding that we have, I think, a sensible and reasonable conversation about the types of migrants that are currently coming to our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, of course, you can talk about the cultural interests as well. It's often said we're a multicultural country. We come from many different cultures; there are hundreds of cultures that have come here. We've come from many, many different lands, but we're united by the Australian culture. It is an amazing amalgam of Western European, Asian, Aboriginal and African culture. They've come together and are working together under law and order.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The progress that was made throughout our history was because. when people came to this country. they brought elements of their culture to add to ours that built upon and strengthened it. We often hear these trite sayings: 'We wouldn't have Italian restaurants if it weren't for the Italians'—or Chinese restaurants. That's one aspect of it. But they also infuse a little bit of their traditions and history within our legal framework and within the social and cultural mores that we've come to expect from our founding values and principles. Unfortunately, that idea, that concept that you should integrate and become part of the broader community is slowly being dismissed. One example of that, of course, is the people who defend the rights of some Middle Eastern women to wear a facial veil. If you're wearing a facial veil in this country, you're cutting yourself off from the rest of society. You're basically saying, 'I don't want to interact with you in that place. I don't want to be able to get a job. I don't want to be able to be a regular part of the Australian community.' I can't understand why people would defend that. Why would we defend the thought that people can isolate themselves from the rest of us and expect us to provide them with all the benefits, protections, safety and great, wonderful things that we have in this country? We have to be able to discuss these things in a rational, considered manner because, otherwise, we will lose some of what makes this country so good.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we come to some of the causes of these problems, it's quite easy to recognise that there is an economic issue at work here as well. The unemployment rates in some migrant communities bear out that we may need to reconsider how we're going to approach our migrant intake. Adam Creighton pointed out in April in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> that South African and English migrants to Australia have unemployment rates of about two per cent. Compare that with the then national rate of around 5.6 per cent. Further, migrants from southern and eastern Europe reported very low unemployment levels as well. But, according to the latest ABS data, 44,000 of the 70,000 migrants from the Middle East and North African region were unemployed or not seeking work. It's worth noting that, exclusively within the refugee intake, Croatian refugees had a four per cent unemployment rate but Afghan, Iraqi and Sudanese refugees had an unemployment rate of between 19 per cent and 22 per cent. I do note that there will be people who will say, 'We need to do more for these individuals.' I would counter that argument and say that perhaps we should reflect on our capacity to do what we can within the financial constraints that we have and the demands that we have on the system, which is already creaking under the yolk of debt because we've got too many people taking from the system rather than contributing to it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An analysis of 2011 census data by the Department of Home Affairs shows that, if you take away the aged southern European demographic, the demographics with the highest levels of unemployment are those from the Middle East and North Africa. It also suggests that the employment-to-population ratio for Australian-born citizens is close to 80 per cent, yet those born in these two other regions have a much lower average of just under 50 per cent. There is a significant difference here. As we've got a national debt which is growing, as we have a welfare debt which is consuming an ever-larger part of the budget, we need to ask ourselves: can we sustain this?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Department of Social Services data last year showed that, of 33,000 refugees that were on unemployment benefits a year after they arrived, that number fell to 21,000 refugees three years in, but there were still 17,000 or thereabouts on welfare after five years. Over that time, the number of refugees on single parenting payments, carer payment and the disability support pension actually rose. You can go through it. If you run back over that data, it says that, in that period of time, 40 per cent of the people who were born in Iraq and who are in this country are on welfare. It's 29 per cent for those who were born in Lebanon, 25 per cent for those from Sudan and 23 per cent for those from Afghanistan. Yet, for countries like South Africa, it's just three per cent. It tells a stark story about how we can sustain such high levels of unemployment or welfare dependency in sections of the community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can determine the make-up of the immigration intake that we have here in a compassionate and reasoned manner that is consistent with our economic, our social and our cultural interests. When it comes to that, we need to review a number of areas. We have to make sure that immigration continues to have a positive benefit for all of us. We need migrants to continue to contribute to Australia. We need to get them off welfare and into the tax system, we need to reform our visa assessment processes and, most of all, we need to halve our migration intake until we can catch up to the demands that are already on the system.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="247871" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'SULLIVAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  It'll come as no surprise to colleagues that I intend to devote my 10 minutes or so to talking about the bush—regional and particularly rural Australia. In fact, it's an extension of a speech that I made in this chamber last week on the same subject. I'm determined to continue to educate colleagues in this place and the other place about the challenges that exist in rural Australia in particular and to continue to advocate for us as legislators to consider the impacts of any decisions we make in this chamber with respect to the welfare and the future of rural Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I shouldn't need to, but I will remind all colleagues, and anyone who's listening, that there's not one single feature in our lives that doesn't start with primary production. Everything we're wearing, everything we're sitting upon, everything we'll eat today and tomorrow, all the pharmaceutical products we use, the car we drive, the tyres on the car and the bitumen in the roads—all of that, the genesis of every element of the creation of those commodities—comes from primary production. It might come as a surprise to some, who don't get around much, that there is no broadacre farming in Pitt Street and no horticulture in Collins Street. Whilst there are some knee-high boots and some fancy white hats in Queen Street, they're not generally worn by people of the bush. We have a whole generation of young people—and I'll exclude those in the gallery today, because I'm sure they've got a much more acute awareness of what happens in rural Australia, but there are some people—who think milk simply comes out of a carton and the carton comes out of a fridge and the fridge itself comes out of a Harvey Norman warehouse on the docks of Melbourne.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of those things started with primary production. They started with the production and maintenance of livestock enterprises across the country, or they started on the end of a shovel. Yet—and this featured in my maiden statement—we need to constantly bring the bush and primary producers and the efforts of sustainable resource management to the fore of our minds as we make every decision in this place. I want you to imagine for a moment that your local shire says to you—and this is actually the case in Diamantina and so many other shires in my home state of Queensland—'We're going to increase your rates, because we have to devote one-third of your rates base to the operation of our airstrips.' And they're not aerodromes; they're airstrips. One third of the rates base is devoted to providing that simple connection to the outside world, principally for emergency services. A lot of these airstrips don't even provide commercial travel; they're just there so that the Royal Flying Doctor Service and others can land and provide medical support to the communities to come in and do missions and clinics, as well as of course being able to pick up people whose health circumstances are in dire straits—imagine that. On top of that, if you've had an accident on the edge of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide or wherever, imagine if I said the helicopters couldn't get to you within 15 or 20 minutes but that it would take 15 or 20 hours to respond. The people who live in the bush have underpinned the wealth and wellbeing of our nation since Federation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Imagine if I said we're going to close the post office and make the ratepayers buy the post office back and fund it out of the rates base to keep our community service obligation alive. That happens in the bush. Postal services leave the community because of economic rationalism. I have been a bitter critic of Australia Post about this over a long period of time. Imagine if we went door to door around our communities and said to people that they would need to dig deep into their pockets and pay for that in addition to the payments they are making now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In most of the communities that I move around, the aged-care facilities, as limited as they are, are funded in many cases with contributions from the rates base and otherwise by the community itself. Medical centres and medical services are not like we have in the city, where you get in a cab and go in any direction and find a medical clinic or a hospital with a 24-hour emergency department. Many of these communities don't even have a medical practitioner. Where they do have medical clinics and centres they are often subsidised directly by their community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Imagine 100 kilometres of roads in a city. That is divided by one million people. If you have 100 kilometres of roads in the bush, it is divided by sometimes 80, 90 or 100 people—and in many instances they are responsible for the maintenance of those networks so that commodities can be moved along them and people are able to move about within their remote communities. I met a woman in Stonehenge in Queensland. She talked about the 104-kilometre trip she does every day to take her two young children into school in Stonehenge. She talked about arriving there and not really knowing what to do. The husband is away from the property because of the drought. Stonehenge doesn't hold many attractions for you to spend six or seven hours at while you wait for the kids to come out of school. So this woman has to drive home and then come back in and then drive home again. She does 416 kilometres per day just to give her children access to basic education—in this case, in the public system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we make decisions around funding, as we make decisions around services, I urge that we constantly put in the frame the circumstances of people who live in rural, regional and remote Australia. You might say that, if you choose to live out in the never-never, these are features of life. Indeed they are. These people are under no illusion. They don't expect to pick up their mobile phone and dial and get a line every minute of the day. From my own experience on one of the properties that we have, you have to drive a considerable distance down the road and get yourself up onto a particular hill before you can use the phone. In a modern world, where we want everything done on the internet, they don't get the access. Here's the deal: they know that; they understand the challenges around the delivery of communications. But they don't want their bank leaving town because 90 per cent of the customers now do their business on the internet. They don't have the internet. We make decisions around community service obligations. We make funding decisions around the people who provide communications in the country—Optus and Telstra—and we are still working under archaic community service obligations about the maintenance of fixed-line telephones. Some people are now up to 100 kilometres away from where there's a fixed-line telephone. You want to do business with our government? It doesn't matter who's in government. We can share this load equally. You want to do business with the Commonwealth government or the state government? We're now all online. Well, they don't have an 'online'—unless, of course, you're communities like Stonehenge, Windorah or Quilpie, who dig deep into their rates base and put $6 million towards bringing the fibre optic through, out of their own skyrocket. Imagine if we went to your door and said, 'You know, we'll take your entire rates base for five or six years and invest it so you can go on the internet.' Colleagues, keep them centre of mind as we make decisions.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:55</span>):  I want to share with the Senate, in the short time that I have, an important event that's going to happen on Sunday, 1 July. It will be the 40th anniversary of self-government in the Northern Territory, and I thought it'd be a really good time for the Senate to be aware of just what the Northern Territory's all about. I would like, at the end, to table this document, if I may take leave for that, Mr Acting Deputy President Whish-Wilson. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's an important part of the Northern Territory: the Northern Territory flag. Many of you would know the flag, I'm sure. It's the only flag in Australia that doesn't have the colour blue, unlike the flags of the states and the other territory, the ACT. Our Northern Territory flag is ochre and black and has the Southern Cross on it. The floral emblem on our flag is the Sturt's Desert Rose. The Sturt's Desert Rose is normally known to have five petals. But on this flag it has seven. I always say that the seven is about the fact that there are six states across Australia and seventh one is unfinished business here for the Northern Territory. Our flag was designed not by a Territorian, unfortunately. It was designed by a Victorian. Mr Robert Ingpen designed it for the 1978 launch of self-government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a tremendous way to go in the Northern Territory. We have made many steps along the way for constitutional development and growth for the people of the Northern Territory. We even voted no against statehood. That was 20 years ago, in 1998. We only just voted no, but there was a significant reason behind it. It wasn't because the people of the Northern Territory did not want constitutional development. It was a matter of process that got stalled and stymied just before the eleventh hour, as my colleague on the other side would remember. The aspiration of the people of the Northern Territory is for equality, to be equal with our fellow Australians in the other states. This is what the people of the Northern Territory are going to be thinking about, along with the fact that it is a significant day generally. </span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many people in the Northern Territory who, perhaps, don't know that sort of history, especially when they've come from other states around Australia or from overseas. The First Nations peoples as well very much aspire to be equal in this country in constitutional development. In the Northern Territory we have over 100 Aboriginal languages. Those languages are recognised in the Aboriginal Interpreter Service. But we need them to be recognised far more broadly across our country, respected constitutionally in every way possible. The Northern Territory is reliant on a fair distribution of GST that takes into account our high level of need, our disproportionate level of disadvantage, and that all Australians, no matter where they live, should have equal access to critical government services such as health, housing and education.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a long way to go. We have so many houses that still need to be built across the Northern Territory. On Territory Day, on Sunday, many people of the Northern Territory will be reflecting on their place in Australia. I ask senators here to consider, wherever you are, that there is unfinished constitutional business for the people of the Northern Territory, for the First Nations peoples across Australia, especially for those who will be coming together on this significant day on Sunday. Remote Australians, remote Territorians, are not second-class citizens and should not be expected to cop second-class service. Make sure on Sunday, as the people of the Northern Territory reflect, that this Australian Senate also does. Mr President, I seek leave to table a document.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Finance, Special Minister of State and Vice-President of the Executive Council</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:00</span>):  My statement was a statement of economic fundamentals—economics 101. If you attract more investment and generate stronger growth, and more jobs are being created, as they are under our government, then there is more competition for workers. As you start depleting the excess supply in the labour market, and if there is stronger demand for workers and less supply of workers, of course wages will go up. That is a very basic economic fundamental.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we came into government, the economy was weakening, unemployment was rising—which is, of course, part of the reason why we went into a period of lower wages growth, because if wages had grown more strongly at the time of a weakening economy and rising unemployment then more people would have ended up unemployed. But what has been happening, as a result of our plan for a stronger economy and more jobs—as more than a million new jobs have been created in our period in government—is: of course, the excess supply in the labour market has continued to deplete. As more jobs are being created, there is more demand for workers and less supply of workers. That is basic market economics. Stronger demand and lesser supply drives prices up. If you've got lower demand and higher supply, prices go down. That is basic market economics.</span>

                  </a>  So, under Mr Shorten, taxes on business will be higher, so there will be less investment, lower growth, fewer jobs, higher unemployment, less competition for workers and, consequently, lower wages. Under our plan, there will be lower taxes on business, which means there will be more investment because we compete for investment with countries around the world. There will be more investment. There will be stronger growth. There will be more jobs. There will be lower unemployment. And, as there is lower unemployment and stronger demand for workers, there will be higher wages. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The truth is: if taxes are higher, the Australian economy will attract less investment. There's no question about that. If you make it harder for business to be successful, business will be less successful. If you make it harder for business to compete with businesses in other parts of the world, they will be less viable and less profitable. A less viable and less profitable business will hire fewer people. All of this is basic common sense. None of this is rocket science. This is the way the market has worked since time immemorial.</span>

Here's a newsflash for you: business wants to pay as little as they can for anything they buy, whether it's products, whether it's services, whether it's their workers. And workers want to get as much as they possibly can get. And then there is the market; there is supply and demand. Business will not pay higher wages because they want to but because they have to, because if they want to manufacture products, if they want to deliver services, if they want to export products and services around the world, they can't do it without a workforce. And the more successful they are in creating products, in building things, in selling products and services around the world, the more workers they need. As they want to hire more workers than they otherwise would, competition for workers will be stronger than it otherwise would be, and the workforce across Australia will have more bargaining power than they otherwise would.

This morning I released the Australian government Monthly Financial Statements for the 2017-18 financial year to the end of May 2018. They show that revenue from company tax this financial year has increased by another $1.1 billion since the most recent budget was released only last month. This means that, since the Senate passed the first three years of our Ten Year Enterprise Tax Plan, revenue from company tax, just for this financial year, has increased by $9.2 billion—that's right. So, at the 2016-17 half-yearly budget update, which was the first one after the 2016 election and the last one before the Senate passed the first three years of our Ten Year Enterprise Tax Plan, the expectation was that businesses would pay $78.6 billion in company tax revenue in 2017-18. Based on the official numbers, on actual revenue collections to the end of May 2018, one month out from the end of the 2017-18 financial year we are now expecting company tax revenue to come in at $87.8 billion. That's right: $9.2 billion more than estimated at the 2016-17 MYEFO. And of course to the end of May 2018, these are actual numbers—actual numbers.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This demonstrates that the government's plan for a stronger economy, for more jobs and to repair the budget is working. The reason we're collecting more revenue is stronger growth, higher than assumed commodity prices and strong multinational anti-avoidance measures and tax enforcement action. Not only do lower taxes help Australian businesses to employ more workers but also more-profitable businesses pay more tax, which helps Australian families to get ahead and helps the government to fund the important and essential services that Australians expect their government to provide.</span>

The evidence is that these measures are working. The establishment of a Tax Avoidance Taskforce within the ATO, along with the ATO's cross-border compliance activities, has resulted in $2.7 billion being clawed back from multinational companies operating in Australia. The government's actions to broaden the scope of large multinationals being subject to the multinational anti-avoidance law and diverted profits tax has resulted in 44 taxpayers bringing their Australian-sourced sales back onshore, which the ATO expects will result in an additional $7 billion in income being returned to the Australian taxpayers per annum. In addition, approximately $461 million in additional GST has been paid in 2017-18, to the end of May 2018, as a result of some global entities restructuring in response to the multinational anti-avoidance legislation we passed. A total of 318 multinational companies are now under active audit— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Mr Shorten stands for higher taxes, less investment, lower growth, fewer jobs, higher unemployment and lower wages. That is what they delivered when they were last in government and that is what they want to inflict on the Australian people again. The government want Australian families today and into the future to have the best possible opportunity to get ahead. That is why we want to ensure that the businesses that employ them have the best possible opportunity to be competitive, viable and profitable into the future, and that is why we stand for a lower, globally-more-competitive business tax rate. It is all about making sure that working families across Australia have the best possible opportunity to get ahead and to be successful.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you very much, Mr President. My answer very directly to the question is that the coalition will always do what is right by the economy, will always take decisions based on wanting to deliver stronger growth and more jobs, and that is what we will do in relation to our plan for low electricity prices and more reliable energy supplies, unlike the Labor Party. Mr Ross Hart, the member for Bass, was so embarrassed by what Mr Shorten did yesterday to small business in Tasmania that he wasn't even prepared to back him up. What I would say to the good people of Braddon is: if the Labor member for Bass is not prepared to back up Mr Shorten's plan for higher taxes on business, don't vote for Bill Shorten's candidate in Braddon, because he will send your jobs overseas; he will drive your wages down. Not even the Labor member for Bass agrees with Mr Shorten's plan for higher taxes on business. In fact, this is what I would say to the Labor voters in Braddon: if you want a more sensible Labor leader, if you want a Labor leader that is not at war with business, put Bill Shorten's candidate last, because that would get us Anthony Albanese as the Leader of the Labor Party. Every Labor voter in Braddon who wants a change of leadership in the Labor Party, put Bill Shorten's candidate in Braddon last. Not even the Labor member for Bass is prepared to back Bill Shorten up, because he is reckless to the economy. It is Bill Shorten and the Labor Party that want to destroy our economy and want to destroy jobs.</span>

The Labor Party today is deeply divided. The alternative leader of the Labor Party, Mr Albanese, is concerned about Mr Shorten's war on business, and he's right to be concerned. Today, of course, we've seen that the local member for Bass, Mr Hart, is not prepared to back up Mr Shorten. Presumably, he's in the Albanese column. We want to know from Ms Keay, in Braddon: is she in the Albanese or the Shorten column? Is she in the pro-business or the anti-business column? Is she in the pro-jobs or the anti-jobs column? If she is supporting Mr Shorten's war on business, she should be put last. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The Labor Party, we know, have two factions. We've got the anti-business, war-on-business, socialist faction, led by the current leader of the Labor Party, Mr Shorten, and we've got the pro-business, pro-growth, pro-opportunity faction, led by—who would have thought!—Mr Anthony Albanese.

Minister, the South Australian royal commission is today hearing from a former CSIRO scientist who alleges that the MDBA actively suppressed the CSIRO's evidence that the Basin Plan target of 2,750 gigalitres would fail to secure the future of the river. Your government is going to the High Court to avoid appearing before the royal commission and answering questions. You're hiding departmental officials and MDBA officials past and present, and hiding documents, and now we're seeing the CSIRO being asked to hide as well. When is this government going to give the people of South Australia the respect they deserve, stop hiding and tell the truth?</span>

As has been expressed by the government, the government is willing to assist the South Australian royal commission in its inquiry into the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. However, there is no jurisdiction for a state based royal commission to use coercive powers against the Commonwealth, including its agencies and employees. That's why, a couple of weeks ago, the Commonwealth and the Murray-Darling Basin Authority did initiate action in the High Court seeking an order to set aside the summonses for the production of privileged legal information held by the Commonwealth and for the appearance of Commonwealth officers at the royal commission.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Commonwealth argues that the use of summonses against the Commonwealth is a coercive power outside the remit of the royal commission established under the state's Royal Commissions Act. A couple of weeks ago, on 13 June, the South Australian royal commissioner, Bret Walker SC, suspended the requirement for the Commonwealth, its agencies and employees to comply with the summonses until the issue has been decided by the High Court in the near future. No hearing date has yet been set down by the court.</span>

We are the government that is delivering this basin plan. It was a Liberal-National government that established the funds to deliver the basin plan. And it is a Liberal-National government that is now delivering this plan, including through the passage of legislation this week to help ensure that we deliver the plan in full. We will be delivering a plan that improves the environmental performance of the river, that helps deliver more water to South Australia but that also helps protect the food producers of this country and what they produce, what they deliver, for our nation. The jobs they produce, the food we eat, the clothes we wear—all of these things are important. </span>

I'm so proud to be part of a government that's put in place a $75 billion decade-long pipeline of transport infrastructure projects. It's just remarkable. For those on the other side who are wondering, 'How did you do that?' what we do is deliver a strong economy. We've got a great economic team delivering a strong economy, and the benefits of that strong economy have to flow back to Australians. </span>

There are 1,100 families who would not be saying, 'I've got a new job today!' or 'I've got a new breadwinner today!' It is simply beyond Labor. </span>

We are leaving a legacy of jobs, jobs and jobs. That's why we've grown our economy. All these projects are job-creating superchargers. There are 50,000 direct and indirect jobs right across our nation. There is the $600 million Northern Australia Roads Program. We continue to strengthen the budget position. We can continue to invest in vital infrastructure across Australia. </span>

This government is investing significant funds in Tasmania building on our prior commitments under which 12 projects are complete and five projects are still providing jobs. There is an ongoing investment of $400 million in the Midland Highway upgrade. There is $461 million to replace the Bridgewater Bridge. There is $400 million under Roads of Strategic Importance. There is $59.8 million to deal with the second tranche of the Freight Rail Revitalisation program. We might have some sparks from those opposite, particularly those Tasmanian senators who don't like us to deliver for Tasmania and for Braddon. Unfortunately for them, we are going to keep doing that. Electorates like Braddon will receive millions of dollars in additional funding. Importantly, this creates jobs for Tasmania. They have their share of the 1,100 jobs that we create every day because we run the economy and make investments so that Tasmanians can benefit.</span>

We have indicated $119.6 million for tranche 1 of the Freight Rail Revitalisation program. This is delivering benefits to people in Braddon.

Minister, in the 'nominations of land' guidelines that you issued for the site selection process you stated that 'community support is a key consideration for a nomination to progress. A facility will not be established where there is not broad community support.' Minister, what is your definition of broad community support? What percentage of the local community constitutes broad community support in your eyes and the eyes of your department? If the answer is 'it depends', how do you justify spending taxpayers' money on a vote seeking a definitive number?</span>

I also recognise his well-engaged interest in this very important issue. Up-front, I would like to confirm what Senator Patrick has said, and that is that community support is central to the decision about a location for a radioactive waste facility in this country. It has been central to this entire decision-making process. We do have three sites, in two communities, now progressing. It is the views of the people of Kimba, Hawker and surrounding regions that will now determine whether this waste facility will proceed or not. It is their views which are most important, not my own and not those of other senators in this place. It is the views of the people on the ground which are the most important.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Patrick asked about the definition of broad community support and whether we have a definitive number. The first thing I would like to point out is that the formal vote that will be occurring in the Kimba and Hawker regions is only one input; it is not the only thing the government is doing through this process to judge community support. Yes, of course, that will be a very important factor; but we are also taking submissions and views from people who live outside the formal regions. Obviously, we need a definitive region to take an electoral roll from; but there are people outside those regions who also have an interest and a stake, and their views will be considered. The views of neighbouring landholders of the potential sites will obviously be prioritised, given the greater stake they potentially have with a facility locating next door to their land. Also, the views and interests of Indigenous communities in Hawker and Kimba will be given great weight.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of those factors will come in to define broad community support; it will not simply be the result of the vote.

I have said before that we're seeking broad community support and that the number is not just a simple majority. The number needs to be considered to define the support across a broad level of the community. The results of the decisions we've made previously to take projects forward to the next stage are on record, and I would contend that the support of 57 per cent of people in a community is very strong support, particularly for a proposal that obviously has some degree of contention.</span>

It's remote—I visited it and, if there is a goanna on it, it is because it is passing on its way to some other place that's better; it's not on agricultural land; it is a deep hard granite rock site; and it has the purported support of the community. They are not asking for public money; just the opportunity to be considered. Why have you not advanced this? Are you going to impose upon us— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I have met the nominees of that site as well as the local mayor recently to discuss that proposal. I would point out first that the sites that have been progressed at Kimba and Hawker do meet the requirements that the government needs for the facility. The fact that sites are inhospitable is not a necessary condition for a facility. Indeed, much of Australia's radioactive waste currently is stored perfectly safely 30 kilometres from Sydney, at Lucas Heights—a site where 400 people go to work every day. We do however need to find a permanent, long-term store, because we are running out of space at Lucas Heights.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the media environment is challenging and is rapidly evolving, and this has presented challenges for all media organisations, but particularly for small publishers in regional areas. With this new fund, smaller publishers in Tasmania and right around Australia will have an opportunity to seek funding for projects to assist them to transform their business models, become more efficient and have a greater chance of success in the modern media environment. Local communities, we know, value having good, local content and local news. Having a strong, healthy and diverse media sector is one of the critical underpinnings of our democracy. That's why as a government we've delivered comprehensive and historic reforms to our media laws and why we've established this package of funding to assist smaller publishers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other threat to Australian media organisations is Mr Shorten and his captain's call to increase taxes on thousands of businesses. So the message is clear: if you value your local publishers and support jobs in the media industry, vote for your local coalition candidate if the opportunity presents itself in the near future. Colleagues opposite stand for higher taxes and less support for local Australian media. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Last October, Labor claimed that the National Energy Guarantee would effectively put a price on carbon and involve carbon trading. Liberal Party backbenchers and National Party MPs have also been quoted in the media, asserting that the NEG is a carbon tax by stealth. Given that the Australian people have comprehensively rejected a carbon tax or emissions trading scheme on multiple occasions, are the Labor Party, those Liberal backbenchers and National Party colleagues correct in saying that the NEG is a carbon tax by stealth?</span>

Ultimately the NEG is not a carbon tax. It does not put a price on emissions. It is not an emissions trading scheme. What the NEG does seek to do is put in place a unique condition, working through the retail environment, that addresses reliability concerns whilst ensuring that Australia meets its emissions reduction targets, and it seeks to do that in a context that puts downward pressure on prices over the long term. It is a technology-neutral approach. It doesn't seek to pick any winners. It is an approach that ensures that investment flows to those areas of the energy generation market that can best guarantee stability and reliability whilst ensuring that Australia meets those emissions reduction targets. The modelling indicates very clearly that the NEG will help energy prices in Australia. Around $300 or $400 per household benefit is likely to accrue to households as a result of the type of sound policy that the NEG is, as recommended by the Independent Energy Security Board, as a clear pathway to be able to ensure that we provide ongoing future stability for investment in energy generation in Australia, and, in doing so, know that that ongoing stability will help people to make investment decisions about existing assets, as well as any new investment that can maintain a guarantee of levels of supply that are necessary for Australian industry to have confidence that energy will be available for them, that prices will have downward pressure applied to them, and that, ultimately, all of those things will work in a way that is technology-neutral, without direct subsidy or tax of any part of the energy market.</span>

Of course, the government gives full and proper consideration to any proposal that comes to this Senate, and I'm sure that that bill will receive the full and proper consideration of the government as well. But I would make the point—and it has been made by many people over the years; I particularly remember former Prime Minister Howard making the point on a number of occasions, and I think former Senator Minchin has made the point over the years, too—that, ultimately, the economics are a challenge, in terms of investment in nuclear, and those economics are of course particularly prohibitive, so long as the alternative party of government in Australia basically denies any investment certainty to anybody who wants to consider such a proposition.</span>

Senator Martin, the government's newest senator, has described the Turnbull government's second-rate NBN as like 'driving a Mercedes-Benz to the node and then jumping on a penny-farthing'. Given that three-quarters of homes and businesses in Braddon are stuck with copper connections to the node, does the minister agree that the Turnbull government has forced three-quarters of homes and businesses to jump on penny-farthings?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:44</span>):  Thank you, Senator Urquhart, for your question. Under this government, the NBN is now available to more than half the nation. It will be concluded by 2020, and that is a good six to eight years sooner than would have been the case under those opposite, and at $30 billion less cost. But let me explain to colleagues what this government is doing in using the multi-technology mix. Our mandate to NBN is to use the technology that makes sense in a given area, to see the NBN rolled out fastest and at lowest cost. That approach is what is done in the United States. That approach is what is done in Europe. We are doing what the rest of the world does, and that is: using a range of technologies. It is only in vertical city states, such as Singapore, where they pursue a one-technology approach, because that is something that is cost effective. In large nations, such as ours and the United States, and in places such as Europe, a range of technologies are used, and that is exactly what we're doing. It is because we're using a range of technologies that the NBN is going to be completed six to eight years sooner than would have otherwise been the case. That means the whole nation gets the economic benefits of the NBN much sooner than would have otherwise been the case. NBN have commissioned work by the economic consultancy firm AlphaBeta—work by Dr Andrew Charlton, a former economics adviser to Kevin Rudd—which shows that the economic benefits of the NBN are already flowing through to communities throughout Australia, including Tasmania and the electorate of Braddon.</span>

The ironic thing about Senator Urquhart's question was that she referred to the electorate of Wentworth, which, like a number of capital cities, has what's called the HFC or pay TV cable. Those opposite used to say the HFC pay TV cable was not fit for purpose; it was no good. What they now do is cite that any area that has the HFC pay TV cable is an area that's getting service that's superior to other areas. They can't have it both ways. They can't say that, on the one hand, HFC pay TV cable is no good and can't deliver fast speeds for NBN but then, when it suits their argument, flip it the other way and say, 'Gee, HFC pay TV cable is fantastic. We wish more of the nation had it.' <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

From the time we came into government we said the NBN would be completed by 2020, and we are on track to complete it by 2020. That strategic review also found that those opposite would not have been able to deliver the NBN using their model and approach until about 2026 or 2028 and that it would have cost $30 billion more. If your NBN costs $30 billion more, that means that those who are on broadband would have to pay on average $500 a year more for their NBN. Under us, people get the NBN sooner, the nation gets it at less cost and consumers will get it at $500 a year less than would have been the case under those opposite.</span>

We're delivering better mobile phone coverage through our $220 million investment in the Mobile Black Spot Program, unlike the Labor Party and the previous South Australian Labor government. Regional South Australians missed out, with only 37 of the 867 base stations funded under our program actually being located in regional South Australia. Fortunately for South Australians, things are changing for the better. At the federal level, the coalition is delivering on our commitment to improve mobile coverage, with a further $25 million committed to a fourth round of the coalition's $220 million Black Spot Program. But, now that there is a Liberal state government in South Australia, regional South Australians are in the box seat for better coverage, including the people in the seat of Mayo. The new South Australian Liberal government has committed $10 million to address black spots across regional South Australia, and I look forward to partnering with them. When I was walking the streets of Mayo with the local Liberal candidate, Georgina Downer, we spoke to small-business owners—owners of restaurants, cafes, travel agencies—about the importance of 21st century telecommunications infrastructure and what it means for their local businesses. Our commitment, combined with that of the South Australian Liberal government and a strong advocate like Georgina Downer being elected in the seat of Mayo, will mean that those regional communities will remain vibrant, sustainable and connected to essential emergency services and will use that increased digital connectivity to grow their local businesses and increase local jobs.</span>

When I was recently in South Australia, in the seat of Mayo, with Georgina Downer, we were speaking about the importance of the wine industry to the local area, particularly in the Adelaide Hills. We know the wine industry is worth about $6 billion to the GDP of South Australia and employs a lot of people in that area, but it's an international business and it requires digital connectivity to ensure they can compete internationally. Bec Hardy proudly runs the business Wines by Geoff Hardy with her family in the Adelaide Hills and she spoke about the importance of our investment to her business. It means that, at their cellar door in Kuitpo, customers can check in on social media, post a selfie while enjoying a drop in the Adelaide Hills or place an online wine order, post-tasting, on their mobile handset, allowing them to grow their business and employ more people locally. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The Australian Labor Party's approach to regional telecommunications policy is actually a lot like regional black spots: nothing; silence; absolutely no bars. We can look across the aisle and ask: what are they doing for regional black spots in regional Australia? Let's compare them. Two hundred and twenty million dollars from us has been leveraged with state governments and telcos to deliver $680 million of investment. Labor: silence. There are 867 base stations across the country, which I'm hoping, with our increased investment, will grow to 1,000. But, when we look across the aisle, there is absolute silence. The coalition government is the only government that backs regional Australia and our entrepreneurial spirit through increased connectivity.</span>

Why does this Prime Minister support cutting the penalty rates of 700,000 working Australians again this Sunday while he's trying to cut a deal with One Nation to give an $80 billion handout to big business?</span>

There is no $80 billion handout to big business. The next point I would make is that less-profitable businesses will be less successful and will hire fewer people, and that would lead to lower wages. We had a period of weakening economic growth at the back of the Labor period in government. We had to work to turn that situation around. You're quite right: profits are strengthening, and that is good news for the job security of millions and millions of working Australians. For example, look at the good workers at Qantas. When Labor was in government—at the tail end of Labor's period in government, when Qantas were making $3 billion worth of losses—people were losing their jobs. Qantas have been able to turn the situation around. They're now getting back into profitability, the job security of their workers is improving and the wage increases for Qantas workers are improving.</span>

                  </a>  Well, a business that doesn't make any profits doesn't pay any tax. That is something Senator Cameron doesn't understand. In Australia you don't pay tax on turnover; you pay tax on profit. If a business makes losses, as Qantas was making under the period of the Labor government, the workers are less secure in their jobs, there is less opportunity for new jobs and there is less opportunity for small and medium-size businesses providing goods and services to a business like Qantas. How much better is it that profitability is now stronger? As profitability improves job security, as it increases the opportunity to invest in further business expansion, more people will be hired. As more people are hired and as there is more competition for the remaining workforce that is currently unemployed, then of course wages will go up by more. That is the basic rule of supply and demand. If supply is shrinking and demand is strengthening—which is what we want—then prices will go up. We want demand for workers to go up on the back of stronger economic growth, and of course we want supply of labour to go down because fewer and fewer people are unemployed. Under Labor, rising unemployment; under the coalition, increasing employment. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Resources and Northern Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:00</span>):  I thank Senator Macdonald for his question on this very important matter—a facility in Brisbane that supports up to 1,500 jobs, including 450 jobs at Gibson Island. It is also the only location in Australia where urea is manufactured—a very important input to our agricultural sector. So it is an incredibly important piece of infrastructure for our country. The government has been well aware of the Incitec Pivot's challenges to supply an adequate amount of gas to its facility, and it is great news for Queensland and great news for Australia that, on Monday, Incitec Pivot was able to reach a deal with Central Petroleum    for a 12-month 32-terajoules-a-day gas supply contract that will help keep that plant open. This is very important for our country, and it is at least in part thanks to the action the government has taken on a range of fronts to avert a gas supply crisis that we faced 12 months ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I outlined to the Senate earlier this week, last year we announced a framework to control gas exports if required to make sure there's enough gas in this country. Indeed, we made that announcement at the Gibson Island fertiliser plant in April last year. Since that announcement, and in subsequent agreements with the gas industry, more than 70 petajoules of gas has come back onto the domestic market that would have otherwise been exported. That has meant that there is more gas in the market. It's helped bring down prices by around 25 per cent in most markets. Prices in Australia now are back down, well below what they are in North Asia and exports markets; whereas, 12 months ago the price in Australia was about the same as it was in North Asia, which was quite a paradoxical situation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will continue to act to make sure that businesses right around Australia—not just Incitec Pivot—have adequate supplies of gas and that we protect these very important manufacturing jobs. To have these jobs we need sensible energy policies, we need cheap energy, and we need to make sure that we don't impose unnecessary burdens on our energy sector which would cost jobs and hurt families in this country.</span>

The gas to Incitec Pivot will be delivered from the Northern Territory via the Northern Gas Pipeline, which is due to be completed later this year. The Central Petroleum managing director, Richard Cottee, said that he is 'absolutely convinced' that the deal wouldn't have been possible without recent pipeline reforms driven by the federal government and the competition regulator. These pipeline reforms include requirements on pipeline companies to provide the market with more information about gas flows and to establish binding arbitration to resolve negotiation disputes. By allowing more of these deals to occur to transport gas around the country, we are able to make sure that gas is supplied to where it's needed and when it's needed—and it supports jobs.</span>

We know that Labor governments won't be able to be trusted to provide that sort of energy security because they don't support the development of our energy industry and they don't support the development of our resource industry. Without exploiting our resources, we will not have adequate supplies of energy and we will not have adequate supplies of gas, and it will cost thousands of jobs in this nation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">While it is good news for the country that the gas supply crisis of 12 months ago has been alleviated, it is still the case that to ensure this does not arise over the next decade we develop and find more supplies of gas. That was identified in the Australian Energy Market Operator report earlier this week. That is why this government is right behind making sure we do develop our gas resources, whereas the Labor Party, with the Greens and various state governments, have been blocking the development of those resources. And if they succeed—if they win—jobs will be the cost. If they win, families will be put out of their homes, because these good manufacturing jobs that we need for cheap and successful energy— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Department of Veterans' Affairs acknowledges that it did not handle the case of Mr Martin Rollins well, and that it can and it must do better for our veterans and for their families. I'm advised by DVA that, following various appeals by Mr Rollins, DVA ultimately commissioned an external independent investigation into their handling of his case. This investigation involved the review of a large volume of documents and extensive correspondence between Mr Rollins, the independent investigator and DVA. The investigation also identified systemic issues that have informed the major reform program currently underway to transform DVA processes, systems and culture.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Hinch referred to an email in his remarks to the Senate last week. The Department of Veterans' Affairs has confirmed that the email referred to by Senator Hinch both exists and was considered by the independent investigator. In view of the email and the statements contained therein, it is difficult to see how this change in policy did not disadvantage Mr Rollins.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following the independent investigation into Mr Rollins' case, I am advised that DVA reversed its decision in relation to his claims and provided Mr Rollins all benefits to which he was entitled. Based on this information, it is evident that there were, and may still be, cultural issues in the department that do need to be addressed. Accordingly, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and I have asked the new secretary of DVA, Liz Cosson, to review the findings of the independent investigation; to identify any shortcomings, particularly as they relate to the culture of the organisation; and to report to the government as soon as possible.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to the question that Senator Hinch asked relating to costs, I am advised by DVA that a total of approximately $609,000 has been expended since 2009 to address Mr Rollins' claims and the subsequent independent investigation of DVA's handling of the case. Of this, approximately $506,000 was expended on the independent investigation and report, with the balance of around $103,000 expended on addressing Mr Rollins' claims.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Secretary for the Department of Veterans' Affairs is meeting with Mr Rollins' solicitor this week to discuss Mr Rollins' concerns and to ensure that he is receiving the support that he needs. I am aware—through you, Madam Deputy President, to Senator Hinch—that this is a matter that is within the purview of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. However, I do understand your very serious interest and I undertake to you and to the chamber to continue to engage on this matter and to provide any information that you should require.</span>

I will ask the minister to take on notice that it's been confirmed, as you mentioned, that DVA has employed six separate firms since 2008 to fight Mr Rollins' claim. Could you have the department provide a specific breakdown of how much each of those firms were paid, rather than the global amount that they've come up with? Thank you.</span>

Senator Anning asked a question about a specific family day care fraud case. While I cannot, without potentially jeopardising or prejudicing proceedings, comment on matters currently before the courts, I can confirm what is already in the public domain—that is, that the Australian Federal Police have charged two people with offences following an investigation into alleged fraudulent family day care payments and that this matter is before the courts. Subsidies to this service were immediately stopped once the fraud was discovered, and both the New South Wales government, under national law, and the Australian government, under family assistance law, subsequently cancelled the service as part of the ongoing crackdown on family day care fraud that I outlined to the Senate yesterday.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Communications (Senator Fifield) to a question without notice asked by Senator Urquhart today relating to NBN services in Tasmania.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was another question on how the Liberals' National Broadband Network is failing the people of north-west and the west coast of Tasmania. It clearly referenced comments from the then Devonport mayor, now National senator for Tasmania, Steve Martin—a man who once prided himself on his independence, but who has sold himself down the river and joined the New South Wales Nationals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Martin said that the Liberals copper NBN is like 'driving a Mercedes-Benz to the node and then jumping on a penny-farthing.' A penny-farthing! I think that's a bit harsh on the people of Evandale and their wonderful penny-farthing festival, but the spirit of Senator Martin's comments ring true. His comments were opposed at the time by the belligerent Brett Whiteley, a man who just doesn't care; a man whose sole focus in public life is to attack, to demean and to push all responsibility onto individuals. Mr Whiteley's purpose for being in government is not to achieve things for our communities in Braddon, but to push his extreme ideology, which is so out of touch with what workers want, what businesses want and what the community needs. He wants to divide our community into haves and have-nots; he wants to back in his mates in Canberra over the needs of people of rural and regional Tasmania. The fact is that the CBDs of Devonport and Burnie have missed out on fibre-to-the-premises NBN for one reason and one reason only: Brett Whiteley was too weak to stand up to Mr Malcolm Turnbull, the then communications minister.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Martin said last year:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">It's easy to set up a business in Launceston or Hobart because the infrastructure is already there and it's there for the future …</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what he said. He went on:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Fibre to the node is catered for the present day—it's not futuristic. We're not second-rate citizens on the North-West Coast.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Alderman Martin then concluded by accusing the coalition government of not doing its homework and questioned:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… how long is the copper going to last anyway?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">A few weeks ago, Senator Martin said that he would work within government to deliver more positive outcomes in areas like health and infrastructure, but since then he's made no effort to outline how he will actually make a difference. Today he asked a soft question to Minister Scullion, but sought no answers for the people of Braddon on the misleading comments made by Senator Colbeck and Mr Brett Whiteley on the Roads of Strategic Importance fund.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Back when Senator Martin made his comments as a mayor, he was joined at media events with the then Burnie mayor, Anita Dow. Unlike Senator Martin, who was just throwing loose barbs around with no substance, Ms Dow was trying to get some policy changes out of the Turnbull government. Ms Dow was trying to secure a fibre-to-the-premises rollout for Burnie after the Turnbull government brazenly shafted them, despite earlier promises. But, after meeting with NBN representatives, the then Braddon member, Brett Whiteley, and Minister Fifield's staff, Ms Dow was left extremely disappointed. Instead of working with the council to remedy the debacle, Brett Whiteley told the businesses of Burnie they could get a tax deductible connection to fibre to the premises, but of course the businesses of nearby Somerset, just five minutes down the road, did not have to pay; the businesses in Smithton, an hour down the road, did not have to pay; and the businesses in Launceston and Hobart did not have to pay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Whiteley said at the time that Ms Dow should be more positive. What an absolutely disgraceful thing to say about a hardworking mayor, as she was then. He then said the evidence clearly shows that the satisfaction rate of FTTN network users is equal to users of the gold-plated FTTP technology, which is blatantly misleading. The real fact is that fibre-to-the-node experiences three times as many complaints as fibre to the premises—three times; not a bit more, not double, but three times. Brett Whiteley got this fact so horribly wrong because he didn't listen to the concerns of the people of Braddon. He didn't listen to then Mayor Martin when he said copper would deteriorate, that FTTN left north-west Tassie behind Launceston and Hobart and that the Liberals were treating north-west Tasmanians as second-class citizens, and they continue to treat north-west Tasmanians as second-class citizens. He didn't listen then and he doesn't deserve to be re-elected now.</span>

Her contribution just then highlights the fact that the question was not so much about broadband; it was about the fact that the ALP is clearly concerned about the campaign being run by Mr Brett Whiteley in Tasmania. He was an effective member before and he will be an effective member into the future, and, more importantly, he will be an effective member of a government which is transforming Australia's economy such that people who wish to have effective communications can afford to actually purchase the services to have effective communications, as well as all the other services that Australians expect governments of various levels to provide, whether that be for health or education, social security or, importantly, the defence of the nation. Brett Whiteley will be part of a team that allows the growth in our economy to afford those services.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's come to the issue of the NBN. What we saw with the NBN that was promised by those opposite, which they so vigorously seek to defend in this place, was an on-the-back-of-an-envelope type plan of something that locks in a particular technology. As we look around the world, countries like the US, the UK, Germany, France and others roll out a technology mix. NBN multitechnology includes fibre to the node, some 40 per cent; fibre to the curb, some eight per cent; fibre to the premises, 17 per cent; HFC, 27 per cent; fixed wireless, five per cent; and satellite, three per cent. Why is that important? It's important because Australia is a wide and varied place with different communities. South Australia is a great example where we have many small communities with large distances to travel and small populations. To try to apply a one-size-fits-all would not be necessarily affordable nor effective. Even the opposition, when they were rolling out their plan, realised that you needed a technology mix, which is why they included things like satellite in the plan that they brought forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we look forward, what we see with technologies such as 5G on the horizon is a continual march of new technology which will revolutionise the concept of the Internet of Things, which means that demand for the internet, for broadband, is not going to be all based around somebody's home or business. The advent of small satellites providing constellations that give broad coverage is the basis of the investment we see from so many firms into the space sector. One of the reasons the government is creating a space agency in Australia to link in with the growing opportunities around the world is to provide an industry base for the kind of venture capital we see already coming to Australia—$5 million, including to one South Australian company that is looking to launch fleets of nanosats as part of this internet of things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those rapid developments in the technology that is responding to consumer demand is why fixed—to the home, to the business—is not the only solution. It's not the solution that the Australian consumer is demanding. The vast majority of people access the internet, access broadband, access data, through their mobile phone, through their iPad, through a range of devices that are mobile. The whole essence of much of our economy and technology now is mobile. People want that in order to actually have the information where they need it in their business place. Now, some people choose to have fibre to the home or fibre to the business, but many people are choosing to move away from the fixed landline concept because they want mobile, because it works for their business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the government, unlike those opposite, is putting in place a system whereby people can get access to the bandwidth that they need at a price they can afford that also uses a technology mix that meets the needs of individual consumers and the vast demographic differences around Australia—our geography and our distances. Their plan would have cost some $30-billion-odd more. This government is putting a system in place more quickly, with more flexibility and more options for growth into the future, which doesn't just stick to an ideological plan on the back of an envelope but actually meets the needs of Australia's consumers and businesses who want to keep growing our economy. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SINGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:21</span>):  Well, a big mistake may have been made by Senator Martin—that big mistake being, of course, joining the Nationals of New South Wales. But if there is one thing Senator Martin is not mistaken on it is the fact that the Liberals' copper NBN has penny-farthing speeds. He said it himself, and today we heard a response from Minister Fifield, who didn't want to go near Senator Martin's interpretation of the Liberals' NBN speeds. But Senator Martin's now sitting as part of the coalition, and he is there, on the record, admitting the speeds that Braddon voters are experiencing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I listened to Senator Fawcett's response. I don't know what he was rambling on about, but certainly he is out of touch with the experiences of the people of Braddon. The experiences of the people of Braddon, as Senator Urquhart outlined, are not the same as those of Prime Minister Turnbull's electorate. Some 99 per cent of Prime Minister Turnbull's electorate can access speeds of 100 megabits per second. That is not the case for the people of Braddon. That just shows you how this government has walked away from regional Australia—completely walked away. And what could be the worst outcome for the people of Braddon is that Brett Whiteley would be re-elected. He was a failed member for Braddon when he was there before, and he would be exactly the same if he was back there again. That is not what we need, and I want to give this Senate an example of just how and why we need Justine Keay re-elected in Braddon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The NBN should be a crucial tool to health services in Tasmania—in all of Tasmania. But in the electorate of Braddon, the Turnbull government's failings are leaving that community at risk of losing crucial health services. We're not talking about using your mobile phone, as Senator Fawcett talked about. We're talking about the use of NBN in our health system. We're talking about the use of NBN in our hospitals—crucial, life-saving operations and services needed in our health system. In designing the node to service for the North West Regional Hospital in Burnie precinct, the mistakes of NBN have meant that decent speeds could not be achieved. Located in the precinct is the Charles Clinic Heart Care, which provides critical care to patients. The key requirement for that heart centre was upload speeds. They needed a guaranteed 10 megabits per second to connect their cardiology equipment through to their main clinic in Launceston. But the coalition government, the NBN, refused to guarantee this speed. The speed the NBN provided was little faster than dial-up. The clinic was faced with having to close the door or significantly reduce their services. This would have been a devastating blow to patients last year. But Justine Keay understood the importance of this clinic to the health and welfare of the people of Braddon. After a public campaign by the heart clinic and Justine Keay, the NBN agreed to build a micronode closer to the hospital precinct. However, they still wouldn't guarantee the upload speed of 10 megabits per second. The heart clinic couldn't wait for the months that it was going to take for the NBN to build a new micronode and weren't happy with not having an upload speed guarantee, so they ended up partnering with Tas Communications, and Tas Communications then provided that long-term solution of a 10 megabits upload speed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Heart disease is a leading cause of illness on the north-west coast of Tasmania. Many patients simply can't go to Launceston to see their specialists but would have been forced to do so with the Turnbull government's shoddy NBN if Justine Keay and the heart clinic hadn't campaigned. If that is not a clear example of why we need Justine Keay back in Braddon and of how the coalition government and the NBN are failing the people of Braddon and regional Australia—and I'm sure there are other examples in other regional electorates where the Liberals are failing the people who live in regional Australia—then I don't know what is. The people of Braddon and the people out in the regions deserve better than the NBN just being at 99 per cent of 100 megabits per second in Malcolm Turnbull's electorate.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator IAN MACDONALD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:27</span>):  I'm surprised Senator Singh mentioned 'heart' so often when one of her Tasmanian colleagues, Mr Hart, can't agree with Mr Shorten and his approach to taxation. But I'm not going to talk about Braddon. I think Brett Whiteley is a wonderful candidate who is so in tune with the electorate that he doesn't need my support to win that electorate. As for Justine Keay, I don't know her; I've never heard of her. All I know about her is that she was taking her pay as a member of parliament when she knew she wasn't entitled to it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am particularly pleased about this debate because I know the people of Longman are very keen to connect up to the NBN. In fact, 86 per cent is the rollout completion in Longman already and 68 per cent of premises have already taken up NBN services. The LNP candidate for Longman, 'Big Trev Ruthenberg', is very keen to see his electorate completely connected to the NBN—and it is being done for the people of Longman at an affordable price. Had Labor's NBN been pushed through, a typical NBN bill in Longman would be an extra $43. That is over $500 a year that the people of Longman would have to pay for their internet connection if Labor's NBN had progressed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition's changes to the NBN on coming to power saved taxpayers around $30 billion, enabling them to avoid the $43 increase in monthly internet bills that Labor's program would have had. What's more, because we changed it and made it more affordable and it could get to households quicker, Australians can connect some six to eight years earlier than would have been the case under Labor's NBN.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the people of Longman are very much aware of the cost-of-living issues and are very much aware that Labor's proposals in the tax field are all about increasing taxes. They know that the state Labor government in Queensland, in their recent budget, increased or introduced five new taxes. And so, as I said, part of the political lexicon of Australia at the moment is, 'Labor increases taxes, Labor taxes more and Labor lies.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These cheaper prices—the $500 a month that the good citizens of Longman will save—are a real benefit if they're concerned about the cost of living, if they're concerned about Labor's proposals for increasing taxes and if they're concerned about, and have to pay, the Queensland Labor government's tax hike in the recent budget. Just like Labor's energy policy led to higher electricity bills, Labor's NBN policy would have led to higher internet bills. That's why, I guess, everybody in Longman knows that Bill Shorten, with his increases in taxes for energy and the NBN, is one 'Bill' the people of Longman cannot afford.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor was promoting a gold-plated NBN, with 1,000 megabits of broadband speed, but, unfortunately for Labor, less than 0.1 per cent of users are buying these top speeds, and less than 20 per cent of users are buying even 100 megabit speeds. So Labor's program—as always, looking after the big end of town, the big unions and big business—was all about that 0.1 per cent of users who wanted those top speeds. The other citizens of Longman are happy with the speeds they're getting, and they're very happy with the fact that they will save $500 a year over what they would have paid had Labor's NBN gone through.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:32</span>):  When Senator Martin was mayor of Devonport, he described Mr Turnbull's fibre-to-the-node network as like 'driving a Mercedes-Benz to the node and jumping on a penny-farthing'. I don't agree with Senator Martin on quite a lot of things, but I have to say that he was spot-on when it came to his description of the Turnbull government's copper based network. I see Senator Cormann over there, smiling, because he knows that Senator Martin and I don't agree on most things. But, on this issue, I can say that I think he was spot-on! I'm always happy to acknowledge when I think that other people are correct.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of a number of reasons why I don't agree with Senator Martin is that the Turnbull government's copper based network is a network that is substantially realised on last century's technology. It's a network which has cost $4 billion more to build than Labor's and has reduced NBN Co revenue by $500 million a year. It's a network on which more than 40 per cent of customers have experienced disconnections, dropouts and other performance issues, and it's a network with which more than 40 per cent of businesses surveyed are dissatisfied—40 per cent of businesses surveyed are dissatisfied! It's a network which leaves Australia's average broadband speeds behind those of places such as Estonia, Bulgaria and Kenya. It's a network which The University of Melbourne technology expert Mr Rob Tucker says will be obsolete by the time it's built. Yet this government has no plans to upgrade its second-rate network for at least the next 22 years. That's 22 years during which other countries will leave Australia's digital competitiveness for dead. By rolling out this second-rate network, those opposite have sabotaged Australia's economy simply to make a political point.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Voters in the electorate of Braddon have been told by the Minister for Communications that the second-rate broadband brought to the north-west coast of Tasmania was the 'signature achievement' of the Liberal candidate for Braddon, Brett Whiteley—the one who lost his seat at the previous election and who has previously lost a state seat as well; so not once did he lose a seat but twice. Let me tell you: you can keep telling people that, because the people of Braddon realise that it's a dilapidated broadband network that's subject to slow speeds, faults and dropouts. Just ask the people on the west coast. Do you think they feel grateful for that? I'm pretty sure they don't. If this was Brett Whiteley's signature achievement, then the rest of his achievements as the member for Braddon were very, very ordinary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government couldn't even ensure that Mr Whiteley's promise was delivered on time. They promised that the fibre-to-the-network rollout to Tasmania's west coast would be completed at the end of the year, and yet the rollout will be just starting by the end of this year. I'm sure it's pretty clear to the west coast residents who are in the seat of Braddon, which Mr Whiteley's running for, that his so-called 'signature achievement' didn't happen because of anything he pushed for. It happened because Mr Whiteley and his Liberal government were dragged kicking and screaming to deliver a fixed-line connection. It was a backflip of absolutely epic proportions, and was brought on by Labor's announcement of a fibre-to-the-premises rollout for the west coast.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of Braddon know that Labor's Justine Keay is the only candidate who will truly stand up for their needs, who will give the workers in Braddon earning less than $125,000 a year a bigger, better and fairer tax cut, and who will look after the people of Braddon no matter what the area, whether it's the NBN, health or education. No matter what the area, Justine Keay will work for the people of Braddon, as she has been doing previously. It's no accident that Mr Whiteley, as one of the 'three amigos', lost his seat last time around. It's because he didn't respect the people of Braddon. He didn't care about the people of Braddon. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  Long may he reign—I'll take that interjection—because the longer he's there, the more votes you lose. We'll take that. What I really want to talk about is the response from the minister to my question. It was a very important question directly related to the form and the attitude that this government has towards transparency, honesty in public policy and telling the facts and the truth, particularly to the people in South Australia. That is, of course, because this government has effectively gagged public servants and officials of government agencies from appearing before the South Australia royal commission into the debacle that is the management of the Murray-Darling Basin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today a very important witness is in the hot seat in the royal commission in South Australia: former CSIRO scientist Dr Matthew Colloff. Today he is giving evidence that shows that the MDBA, the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, pressured the CSIRO to change the evidence that was being given to the authority in line with what the MDBA believed to be more politically palatable. They ignored the advice of the scientist that at least 4,000 to 7,000 gigalitres of water was needed to rescue the river system and to ensure that the Murray-Darling Basin would survive. Those figures were doctored. The evidence was changed because of political interference, because it wasn't convenient for the government at the time. Now we have a plan that is so hopelessly compromised, you've got to wonder where the money—the $13 billion—has gone. It hasn't gone into buying the water that the scientists said, and it hasn't gone into returning the environmental flows that the scientists said were needed, but, I tell you what, it sure as hell has gone into lining the pockets of big, corporate irrigators and donors to the National Party. We know that this evidence has been corroborated by the evidence before the commission last week from David Bell, the former water planner at the MDBA, who said 'yes'—very rightly. He said that the figure was effectively plucked out of thin air because of the political interference within the Murray-Darling Basin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to also pick up on the point that, of course, the Liberal Party candidate for Mayo, Georgina Downer, agrees with this government's approach to cover up and refuse to show up to the royal commission and answer questions. This is the person who is standing to represent the people of Mayo, the Murray Mouth. This candidate agrees that South Australians should be left in the dark. I wonder if this is just part of her strategy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has been keeping Georgina Downer hidden from the electorate and from the media. I even heard Chris Kenny, of all people—that wonderful television presenter on <span style="font-style:italic;">Sky News</span>—the other night suggesting that Georgina Downer wasn't even allowed to come on his show. That's how much she's being hidden. He was missing his friend. Apparently they'd done talks on this show in the past and she's a good panellist. Even Chris Kenny of <span style="font-style:italic;">Sky News</span> couldn't get Georgina Downer on the television, because she was being hidden by the government. They know she's a loser for them. They know they can't trust what she might say, so, just like they're hiding the facts and the truth from the South Australian people, they're hiding Georgina Downer from the media as well. Well, I challenge Georgina to come down to Mayo—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The bill gives effect to the Asia Region Funds Passport (ARFP) in Australia, a multilateral framework that facilitates cross border offering of managed investment funds in participating economies. The participating economies are Australia, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, and Thailand. Singapore, the Philippines and Hong Kong have been observers in the regular ARFP Joint Committee meetings of participating economies and maintain interest in the scheme.</span>

Other participating economies will also be able to sell their products into Australia, meaning increased competition and choice for Australian investors.</span>

Japan and Thailand are now very close to being ready to go live on their arrangements so it is imperative that Australia is also ready.

In particular, recent feedback from New South Wales and Queensland is that some farmers and their partners who have exhausted their three years of payment have not had an opportunity to implement their plans for financial self-sufficiency and remain in financial hardship, mainly due to ongoing poor climatic conditions. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill removes bans on journalists reporting, and the general public discussing, the operations of security agencies unless such communications endanger anyone's health or safety.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill also removes the criminal offence of a person in preventative detention communicating to anyone to whom they are granted access the fact that they are being detained. Detaining someone without charge, then controlling what they say while they are in detention, borders on torture.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Finally, the bill removes criminal offences for advocating terrorism or genocide, because inciting terrorism or genocide is already a criminal offence, such that this additional offence merely serves to suppress the expression of general views. Allowing such views to be expressed allows for rebuttal, and can assist law enforcement agencies identify people with terrorist or genocidal views.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I introduce the <span style="font-style:italic;">Freedom of Speech Legislation Amendment (Censorship) Bill 2018</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Free speech involves both the freedom to communicate and the freedom to receive communications. Yet the Commonwealth restricts what we can read, watch, play and listen to. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This censorship hurts those Australians who would choose to read, watch, play or listen to censored material. And other Australians have a clear option if this censorship was not present: we can choose to not read, watch, play or listen to the material. Free speech includes no obligation to listen. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is a measured Bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It removes the ban on publications, films and computer games on the grounds that they offend against standards of morality, decency and propriety. However, publications, films and computer games that promote, incite or instruct in crime, or that portray children engaged in sexual activity, will continue to be banned, and dealings in child pornography will remain serious criminal offences. Moreover, all publications, films and computer games, including those no longer banned, will continue to be subject to classification rules that restrict access where material is unsuitable for a minor to read, see, view or play.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The message is clear: if you don't want to read a particular book, then don't. If you don't want to watch a particular film, then don't. And if you don't want to play a particular computer game, then don't. However, we should respect the fact that others may have different views. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill makes associated changes. It removes a ban on publications, films and computer games that meet the broad criteria of advocating terrorism, but retains the ban on material that promotes, incites or instructs in terrorism. Arguably Rambo III meets this broad criterion, because it praises the Taliban fighting against the Russians in the 1980s. Publications, films and computer games that promote, incite or instruct in terrorism will continue to be banned. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also removes the obligation on the Classification Board to ban certain advertisements for publications, films and computer games, while leaving in place a discretion for the Board to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also removes some racist law. Currently publications, films and computer games that are legally available across the country are not available in parts of the Northern Territory because of Ministerial decree. Criminal offences apply. My Bill removes this ban, which is thinly-veiled racism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Censorship is not limited to publications, films and computer games, but also extends to content in broadcasting, datacasting and online. This Bill pares back bans on broadcasting, datacasting and online content, with a specific focus on bans affecting services provided behind paywalls, as such services are less likely to involve unsolicited or underage viewing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Current law pushes prudish community standards in broadcasting and datacasting codes of practice. This Bill limits this prudishness so that it does not apply to codes of practice for subscription broadcasting or datacasting subject to access-control systems.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill allows subscription television broadcasters to broadcast X 18+ and R 18+ programs if access to such programs is restricted by disabling devices acceptable to the regulator.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will also allow online content services to host X 18+, R18+, 'category 1 restricted' and 'category 2 restricted' content provided that access to such content is subject to a restricted access system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Finally, the Bill addresses electoral censorship. It removes the ban on broadcasting electoral advertising on election day or on the preceding Thursday or Friday. This ban does nothing to prevent broader electioneering on those days, with many voters casting their votes before election day, and in any case voters need not be shielded from electioneering in order to make well-considered votes. The best way to ensure that votes are well-considered is to make voting voluntary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</span>

                  </a>  Labor does not oppose this motion. Labor acknowledges that there is community debate and concern that the loot box feature can normalise spending behaviour in a gaming context and potentially act as a precursor to problem gambling behaviour. Labor notes advice provided on the website of the eSafety Commissioner which states that some online games include loot boxes that a player opens to find what is inside and that can be obtained through Gameplay or bought using in-game currency or real money. Labor notes that research into the impacts on young people of gambling-like elements in games and simulated gambling is in its early stages and that a recent study suggests that for some children playing social casino games leads to an increase in gambling activity while for other children it can reduce interest in real gambling. Finally, Labor acknowledges that this is an area that may benefit from clarification around potential harms, regulatory definitions and regulatory responsibility.</span>

                  </a>  The last time I looked, the Senate was about representing Australians in Australia. The Greens constantly and repeatedly push for human rights of people overseas. I understand the morality behind this, but when was the last time the Greens moved a motion about protecting or supporting Australians first? Let's talk about homelessness. More than 100,000 Australians are on the streets, every night, homeless. Seventeen per cent of them are 12 years or younger. What about their needs? Where are the Greens on this?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday, I moved a motion about getting a better GST deal for WA. And guess what? The two Greens' senators from Western Australia didn't support it. What about income tax cuts, cutting some slack for ordinary Australians? What did the Greens do? They voted it down. The Greens have shown their hand when it comes to loyalty, and they have none when it comes to Australia. Look after our own backyard before we start worrying about someone else's.</span>

                  </a>  I thank the Senate. The Greens oppose this motion for multiple reasons, which would take more than one minute to go into, but there are also a couple of very simple reasons. This would clearly make electricity far more expensive for people across the country, particularly for the battlers that are already being hit by so many of the other decisions that are being supported by the mover of this motion. Because coal-fired power stations have provided reliable electricity in the past, it does not mean that building new ones is the best way for the future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear and is already demonstrated that investing in renewable energy in a variety of means is delivering cheaper reliable energy for people across Australia, including in Queensland, as well as delivering the many, many more jobs that would come from this. This would be a massive waste of taxpayers' money. It would make electricity more expensive for everybody and also massively increase our greenhouse emissions at a time when we are already not meeting our Paris targets.</span>

                  </a>  The Australian Conservatives will be supporting this motion, but, because the word 'facilitate' means different things to different people, I'd like to clarify that our support is not built around the taxpayer rebuilding, or building or purchasing coal-fired power stations. It is for the government to get out of the way, to provide contractual and operational certainty and to get their bureaucracy out of the way to allow new entrants into the market that will make these determinations on a commercial basis. It has nothing to do with spending of billions of borrowed taxpayers' dollars in building new facilities. I want to put that on the record because I think it's critical that there's no misinterpretation about what the term 'facilitate' means from the Australian Conservatives' perspective.</span>

                  </a>  This is indeed an interesting motion from Queensland senators. As a Queenslander, I certainly acknowledge the first part of the motion: the Queensland government—or at least some of them—are not only willing but indeed keen to consider proposals to open up the Galilee Basin for more thermal coalmining. In fact, they're still issuing exploration licences for it. But, on the second part of this motion, it is quite risible, frankly, for senators from the Liberal and National parties to call on anybody else to take an impartial approach when it comes to coal. As we've just seen from the previous vote, on the motion moved by Senator Hanson, they have done nothing more than promote coal. They are having open warfare in regard to trying to find ways to promote coal above everything else. Frankly, until both Labor and the LNP stop taking millions of dollars in donations from the fossil fuel lobby, they will never be able to be impartial on this issue.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The PRESIDENT:</span>  It's a fair point to raise. Both whips were advised and the chamber was advised on numerous occasions that this was to be a one-minute bell because we had had numerous divisions in the lead-up. This motion was actually about the ordering of business at the Senate next time, and I've made the point in the chamber twice today that, when statements are being made on matters on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>, they should relate to the motion, not necessarily the substance. This motion was about managing the business of the Senate when we resume in August.</span>

But I take the point. I do rely on advice from senators. </span>

                  </a>  In response, I appreciate that, Mr President. I obviously was not able to be here for all of the divisions leading up to this. I've made the point. It was not simply an ordering of business. It was a substantive motion that brings on a bill which will have a conscience vote for a number of parties and enables debate for three or four days. It was not a minor reordering of the Senate business.</span>

And it is quite obvious that, in those circumstances, she would have been paired and in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> for the purposes that she wanted, so I don't know what the fuss is about.</span>

But what I will say is that, if senators, in the future, see something on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> they would like a guaranteed opportunity to get here for, I'm very happy to take that, and I will advise the chamber accordingly.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the current federal budget, $43.8 million was allocated for the Palestinian territories. A key objective of the Palestinian Authority is its pay-to-slay program, which provides financial incentives to terrorists who murder innocent Israeli citizens. In 2018, these terrorism incentive payments are being increased to US$403 million, or around 50 per cent of the total foreign aid to the Palestinian Authority. Convicted Muslim terrorists in prisons for murdering women and children are paid $3,500 per month by the Palestinian Authority, plus extra bonuses for their wives and children. By contrast, teachers employed by the Palestinian Authority receive around US$600 per month. It is vital that Australian foreign aid does not end up contributing to these programs, or the Australian government is funding the murder of innocents by proxy and has blood on its hands.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BERNARDI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:43</span>):  In contributing on this suspension motion by Senator Anning, I would like to endorse some elements of this motion, because I think we have a serious issue where aid money or donations or contributions of any description are going into an organisation and then flowing on to those who are committing acts of terror or are being incentivised to do so. Having been to Israel and met with representatives of the Palestinian media authority, having heard and learnt for myself about the stadiums that are named after people who have blown themselves up—that the size of the stadium is determined by how many people have been killed in their attacks—having heard that their children are named after terrorism and that families are supported financially, I think there is a very good case that we should cease funding organisations and governments if they are sanctioning or condoning this type of behaviour. Every single thing that I've observed, both personally and in a professional capacity from other sources, reinforces that this is going on. I note that no-one is really denying—maybe someone will later in this contribution—the reality of what we're confronting. I note that Senator Leyonhjelm, yesterday, put on the record that those in the Palestinian Authority were elected to four-year terms and are serving their 11th year of those first terms. It is not consistent with our values or our principles or our objectives as a civil society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are those of you who believe that Palestine should exist and should be a separate state and a nation, but that is quite separate to what is being considered here. Senator Anning is, I think, very right to put this on the agenda. I also understand the contentious nature of it. Governments don't want to wade into these sorts of discussions, and nor does the opposition—sometimes the Greens do—but we can't wilfully ignore or remain silent when there are these glaring concerns about Australian aid money and Australian donations that are flowing to organisations and governments that are knowingly funding or financially supporting, via third-party means, terrorist acts. That is the essence of what we're here for. We've got to act in Australia's interests. We have a role to play, internationally. We have a role to play in global affairs, and one of those roles is not to remain silent in the face of such atrocities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It can go on to the Human Rights Council at the United Nations. Having been there and observed that, we would be wise to reconsider our involvement when the people who are most brutally suppressing human rights, as we know them, are often in charge and make up the numbers on it. They continue to pass anti-Semitic and anti-Israeli motions through many UN bodies, and the world doesn't seem to want to know. They want to paint one picture: that the Israelis are the great oppressors. In reality, the forces opposed against them are state sanctioned by the Palestinian Authority. Iran spends more on funding terror than probably anything else right through the Middle East. We can't be naive or silent in the face of such realities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Anning, good on you for bringing this forward and good on you for raising, I think, a very difficult issue. It's one that you've had to suspend standing orders in this place to have your voice heard on. Equally, I recognise why some people don't want this to take place, but I do think it is an appropriate place to have a discussion about what is going on in our world around us and what is being sanctioned, aided and abetted not only by our aid money but by Australian donations from individuals who are sympathetic to these causes. That, I think, is an indictment on those involved. It's incumbent upon all of us to stand up and speak the truth to this sort of atrocity.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:48</span>):  I'm grateful to Senator Bernardi for conceding that this is a contentious issue. It's a complicated issue. It's a matter of foreign affairs. It's a dispute that has been going on since prior to 1948. It's one that is disputed and encompasses a whole range of issues that are incredibly complex, so much so that, since before 1948, the world has been unable to resolve this conflict. It's a conflict that has had many spin-offs across the world. It's one of the great tragedies and failures, I think, of the international community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know already that of course the government is monitoring all our aid and is looking at these issues very closely. We certainly do not need a resolution of the Senate to ensure that the government is actually carrying out its fiduciary responsibility in respect to the spending of aid. But it is really the height of all arrogance to think that this Senate, by passing a resolution, would contribute in any constructive or positive way to the resolution of this horrific dispute that has been going on for so many decades. It really is the height of all arrogance to admit that this is a complex matter, a difficult matter, yet say we should bring it to the Senate and have a simple yes-or-no vote on such a thing. I don't think it's right. I think it's consistent with the position the opposition took yesterday in denying formality to these sorts of motions; it does not help with the conflict. I really don't get why anyone would bring such a resolution here, if they're really serious about aid. The government is on top of that and looking at all those issues already and, of course, making those appropriate arrangements. But to think that a resolution of the Australian Senate is going to assist in the resolution of this conflict is just beyond me. I would have hoped the government would have supported—</span>

Senator Bernardi, I think, belled the cat on that argument, quite clearly conceding that these are contested and difficult matters. We had a similar debate yesterday on a matter.

This is a debate that's been going on internationally and in Australia for many years. But don't just bring a resolution to do a simple up-and-down vote to have some sort of moral authority and think that that actually reflects the view of the Senate, when none of these things will be taken in context. We have denied formality for reasons that I think are absolutely consistent with not having contested foreign affairs matters debated in this section of the Senate's time, which is simply for an up-and-down vote; it's an inappropriate way to move forward. This debate won't do this Senate any credit, and I think we ought to be consistent and oppose this suspension.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:52</span>):  The foreign minister wrote to her counterpart on 29 May 2018, raising concerns and seeking assurances that Australian funding does not, in any way, enable or encourage acts of violence. The foreign minister has received a response to her letter and is now working through the next steps. The foreign minister also raised concerns on this issue with her Palestinian counterparts during her visit to Ramallah in September 2016, as did trade minister Ciobo during a visit in December 2016. DFAT maintains strict due diligence, regular monitoring and reporting, and comprehensive financial and counter-terrorism checks are in place for all activities receiving Australian aid in the Palestinian territories. DFAT understands the Palestinian Authority provides to the Palestine Liberation Organization, a parallel entity of the Palestinian Authority, funds for financial assistance to Palestinians convicted of politically motivated violence, and their families, through a martyrs fund. This undermines the prospects of a meaningful peace between Israel and the Palestinians.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DI NATALE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:53</span>):  This chamber deals with many matters that are contentious and complicated. In fact, we just had a vote on something particularly contentious and contested: the issue of end-of-life care and physician-assisted dying. We did that just a moment ago. We will continue to debate matters in this chamber and vote on matters in this chamber that are contentious and complicated. So we don't support denying leave on that basis. If you don't like the motion that's in front of you, don't vote for it; it's simple. If you've got concerns about a motion, just don't support it. If you agree with the sentiment behind a motion, support it. It is an opportunity for us to put on the record our various positions on these matters. Regarding the way denying leave has been used, if we agree with your position, it's not a complicated foreign policy issue; if we don't agree with your position, then it is a complicated foreign policy issue. We don't support denying leave simply on the basis of something being contentious, complicated or, indeed, contested.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I go to the substance of Senator Anning's motion and his disgraceful contribution. To be frank, saying to this chamber that the reason that a political party in this place won't support a particular motion is that they are appealing to one group of the community or are dictated to by one group of the community is repugnant and offensive. I'd much rather, as the leader of a political party, that we embrace people from all faiths, all religions and all backgrounds, with the one exception of the bigots from One Nation and the former One Nation senators. The reality is that the motion by Senator Anning is all about undermining Australia's aid program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard the contribution from Senator Georgiou just a moment ago. He doesn't believe that there's any role for Australia to advocate for human rights or support people who are condemned to a life of poverty overseas. In condemning Australia's aid program and undermining the US, Senator Anning and One Nation senators don't support international aid, full stop. They don't support it. They continue in the long tradition of individuals who don't understand that we are all global citizens and we have a responsibility to our brothers and sisters right around the world to do what we can and to acknowledge the privilege that many of us enjoy in this country. We can look after people here in Australia. That's why the Greens have continued to advocate for an increase to Newstart and why we want to address issues like homelessness here in Australia. We can also extend the support we can give to people living overseas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This undermines the important work of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. I'm sure Senator Anning hasn't done his research, but, if he bothered to look, he'd know that the agency supports 5.3 million Palestinian refugees; it provides food aid to 400,000 people in Syria and one million in Gaza; and it's now facing an unprecedented funding gap, thanks to the decision of President Trump to slash US contributions. We are now weeks away from cutting emergency assistance to men, women and children—people who are living in a displaced environment; people who are struggling to feed themselves and put a roof over their heads. Now is the time to redouble our efforts to support international assistance, regardless of the circumstances, and now is the time to support the UNRWA and not criticise it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="N26" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ABETZ</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:58</span>):  It is important for us to consider what is actually being asked of us today and what Senator Anning's motion is asking us to consider. The action part of the motion reads as follows:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">... calls on the Australian Government to:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(i) maintain scrupulous oversight of Australian aid to the Palestinian Territories ...</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would have thought, even for Senator Gavin Marshall, that would not be an important issue that needs a lot of consideration. I would have thought everybody in this place would be able to give a yes or no answer to whether we should maintain scrupulous oversight of Australian aid to the Palestinian territories. Then the second part says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">... demand proper investigation into the content and delivery of education services provided by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At a time when it has become very apparent that the Palestinian Authority are substituting aid to enable them to support what they call the 'Martyrs Fund'—in other words, the suicide bombers who are seeking to destroy the state of Israel—I think those sorts of questions are rightfully asked, especially when you consider that Israel is the only beacon of democracy in the Middle East.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the only beacon of a society that believes in the rule of law. It is the only society and body politic that has regular elections. Indeed, the Palestinian Authority continue in office. I think they had their last election 11 years ago—whereas in Israel the Knesset have had members who have been of Arab origin, I think about a third of them. There have even been people in the Knesset who have believed in the destruction of the state of Israel. That is how pluralistic a society Israel is. That is why it is such a beacon in the Middle East. And, sadly, that is why certain people want to destroy it. If our aid is unwittingly assisting the destruction of the state of Israel—the beacon that it is of democracy, of the rule of law, of pluralism—I think that is something that is a proper matter for this chamber to consider, and consider in the terms of Senator Anning's motion. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, Mr President, this matter is something that is worthy for us to consider. I support the suspension of the standing orders and the final motion, which really is about the issues at stake in the Middle East. Some of those who serve on the Senate Standing Committees on Foreign Affairs Defence and Trade may well be aware of the questions I have been asking about these issues over a number of years. They are real, live issues. They have been aired and ventilated in the Senate committee process. Indeed, the media have now been exposing it as well and, therefore, it is very timely that Senator Anning should come to this place with a motion of this nature. It does not seek to resolve the Middle East conflict. All it seeks to do—and I re-read the action part of the motion—is call on the Australian government to 'maintain scrupulous oversight of Australian aid to the Palestinian territories'. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I trust that everybody would want scrupulous oversight of all Australian aid, but there is a particular concern in relation to the Palestinian Authority, that I have already outlined, and to demand proper investigation into the content and delivery of education services provided by the United Nations. Similarly, one would want proper oversight of all United Nations aid, but in this particular circumstance there are very real and detailed allegations as to how funding is being misused. In those circumstances it is a real, live issue. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a matter that deserves the consideration of the Senate. I, for one, commend Senator Anning for bringing the motion forward and for having the determination to move the procedural motion to overcome the fact that Labor and the Greens sought to deny leave. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:03</span>):  Let me begin by acknowledging that we meet on the land of the Ngunawal and Ngambri people and pay my respects to elders past, present and emerging. It's a particular honour to be able to serve in the same Senate as Senators Dodson and McCarthy. Let me also note my thanks to the Clerk of the Senate, the Usher of the Black Rod and others for the warm welcome I received when I arrived at this place last month. We here in the Senate are keeping you busier with inductions than you could ever have imagined.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The reaction of my daughter Stella when she realised I was coming to work in this place was one of excitement and concern that I might have to attend too many meetings. I would like to acknowledge the extraordinary personal sacrifices that people in this chamber make to represent their electorates and the impact that this can have on their family lives. I am fortunate to have the opportunity to represent the ACT knowing that most nights of the week I can return home. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I am honoured to become only the ninth senator for the ACT to represent all people of the Australian Capital Territory in this chamber, and to do so as a member of the Australian Labor Party. In the ACT, Senate representation only came in 1975. Walking these corridors, I am aware that I walk amongst giants, as well as standing upon the shoulders of giants that have gone before me. I recognise those who have come before me, from Susan Ryan and John Knight through to Bob McMullan, Margaret Reid, Kate Lundy, Gary Humphries, Katy Gallagher and Zed Seselja. In particular, I would like to recognise Bob for the wise counsel he has provided in my early days in this place. That advice and support, alongside that provided by Annette Ellis, Gai Brodtmann and Andrew Leigh, has been invaluable.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In mid-February this year I commenced a journey, a journey I did not expect to lead me here. For the last four years I have participated in the Vinnies CEO Sleepout. It's an important way to raise awareness and raise funds to address a serious issue in the capital region and across the country, and one we are sometimes insulated from within the Parliamentary Triangle: homelessness and poverty. Earlier this year <span style="font-style:italic;">The Canberra Times</span> reported that one in three people were being turned away by ACT homelessness services because of a lack of funding and resources. In a city as prosperous as Canberra, this shouldn't be the case.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">This year I decided to do something a bit different that took me beyond the 12 hours of the sleep-out. So, in mid-February, I commenced a 790-kilometre walk, a Camino de Canberra, from Hall to Gordon and to all the places in between. I walked with other Canberrans and talked about issues that mattered to them and their communities, not just in the capital region but across the country. I walked with school teachers, community lawyers, social workers, union organisers and everyday mums and dads. While we talked about some of our current challenges—insecure employment, housing affordability, rising utility bills in a city where heating is a must and ensuring kids are getting breakfast before school—we also talked about the opportunities and the capacity to build coalitions across communities despite differences.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I made the 790 kilometres by the skin of my teeth and last week, when the parliament rose, I joined with more than 140 community and business leaders across the capital region to sleep out in the grounds of the National Museum of Australia. The thermometer dropped to minus five degrees, but we were still in an environment that was temporary and safe, with the knowledge that a hot shower and a warm bed were not that far away. This is not the case for more than 100,000 Australians on any night of the year.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said before, this is not where I expected this journey to turn, but the opportunity for me here is to work with you all to address rising inequality across our communities and regions, and to work with organisations like Vinnies to bring dignity and hope to every member of our community. That work is done on the back of the extraordinary network of volunteers across this region. Anyone who thinks Canberra has no soul is unaware of the thousands of unpaid contributions made by Canberrans across so many different organisations every day.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the first people I met in this place was the other Senator Smith. Senator Dean Smith informed me, in that early week, that there had only been three Smiths in the Senate since Federation and that we were two of them. Yet I am not just a Smith; I am a Grealy, a Walsh, a Lloyd, a Centenera and a Garcia. Like the majority of Australian families, my family's story has roots elsewhere: in Ireland, Wales, the Philippines and Spain. The Smiths came from Meath, the Grealys from Galway, the Walshes from Cork, the Lloyds from Brecon, the Centeneras from Bicol and the Garcias from Manila.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">My maternal grandmother came to Australia in the 1890s under a false surname, escaping the poverty of rural South Wales to a hard, distant land. My great-grandmother's portrait of Robert Emmet, the Irish patriot, had pride of place in the Grealy home for more than half a century: a reminder of the fight for freedom and the generations of Irish families that migrated to break the chains of poverty.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">My in-laws left the Philippines in the early seventies for both economic opportunity and to escape the Marcos regime. This story of dislocation, political unrest, poverty and sadness is the overwhelming international narrative of the last 150 years. Yet here in Australia, while suffering homesickness and fear, they found hope, opportunity and compassion.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">This remains a critical and difficult challenge. We have a responsibility to those facing the same challenges our parents and grandparents faced to treat them with dignity and compassion and ensure that their human rights are upheld. We can do better but we won't unless we work across the aisles without fear of an errant quip being used on Sky News. Australia needs to be a leader in human rights within this region—not just in the way we treat those who seek refuge, but also in speaking up for human rights across our region. I commend the work of my colleague Chris Hayes MP in highlighting the humanitarian crisis in Myanmar, with the forced displacement of over 600,000 Rohingya into Bangladesh, the destruction of hundreds of villages and the extrajudicial killings carried out by the security forces. In such circumstances we should not be maintaining a military aid program funding the training of officers of the Myanmar military.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">My parents journeyed to Canberra for public service—not just the notion of doing a job, but being part of something bigger and working for the common good. Their story is similar to thousands of Australians that have moved to this region to play their part in the national story. My mother trained as a teacher, working with kids in Collingwood before coming to Canberra to work for the bureau of stats in a building that had also been moved from Melbourne. She had had to resign because of the marriage bar. She threw herself into family and community life, working with the Caroline Chisholm Society, the Catholic Women's League and starting and running the clothing pool at Marist College Canberra.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">My father lost his parents young and put himself through night school before completing degrees in commerce and economics. Work took him from Brisbane to the mines in the Northern Territory before he made the fateful decision to take up a Public Service job offer in Canberra. In a 30-year career he worked across the industry and science portfolios before spending the last decade of his career in the tax office. Committed to an impartial Public Service, he left his Labor leanings at the door and only actively engaged in politics post his Public Service career.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">My brothers and I had that notion of service reinforced during our education at Sts Peter &amp; Paul and Marist College. My brothers too have committed their lives to the common good and public service, if in different ways. My brother Paul is a senior lawyer with Legal Aid. After 20 years of commercial practice, he decided he wanted to give something much more substantial back to the community. My brother Bernie went from the shop floor of Woolworths Mawson to work for the SDA, and he's worked for them for more than 20 years fighting for a fair go for retail workers for things that many of us take for granted—being able to share public holidays with your family, getting a reward for working unsociable hours and encouraging the public to treat them with some basic respect.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Targeting public servants has been easy game for a number of governments despite the criticality of a strong diverse public sector to deliver the government of the day's policy programs and respond to complex emerging challenges. It has always horrified me how those who dedicate their life to public service can have their work belittled, particularly by those whom they serve. I saw this firsthand as a junior public servant in the old Department of Employment and Workplace Relations with the outsourcing of the Job Network and cuts on the workplace relations side that saw one in four of my colleagues without a job. The expertise and talent we lost may have benefitted other organisations but it punched a generational hole in our capacity to provide comprehensive quality policy advice and placed immense pressure on the public servants that remained.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In engineering and science areas of the public sector it was the beginning of a considerable decline, accompanied by the removal of recognition for professional expertise in the classification structure changes of 1999. In the last 10 years, I have worked in the labour movement for and alongside science, engineering and technology professionals across the public and private sectors. It's easy for politicians to talk about the importance of our children studying STEM subjects at school and then through our TAFE and university systems—expensive and difficult courses. There is no point if there isn't genuine investment in jobs worth doing and career paths with reasonable reward.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In the public sector, at all levels, we have seen a significant devaluing of science and engineering expertise and growing gaps at a time when the challenges we face require more, not less, expertise informing our infrastructure, health, communications, defence, agriculture and water policy areas, with significant cuts to the CSIRO, Australia's flagship science and engineering research organisation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In areas such as defence this is staggering, given the billions of dollars invested in complex technology and its maintenance. In defence the loss of engineering capability was a key factor that led to the maintenance failure and decommissioning of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Manoora</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Kanimbla</span>, at a cost of both the practical loss of critical capability and a capital cost of close to $500 million. And, despite reviews urging the rebuilding of the engineering workforce, instead we have seen further untargeted job cuts and the outsourcing of critical engineering roles.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Strong government needs to be driven by a workforce motivated by the public good rather than commercial interests. Limiting the size of the public sector workforce by artificial staffing levels and then blowing out the budget on contractors and consultants is nonsense, but it is a nonsense that we are all paying for through opportunities lost and through the creation of significant, ongoing conflicts of interest.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Rebuilding public sector capability and integrity won't be easy, but it's a mission that is required if we are to have good government. And rather than rely on a 'cargo cult' mentality that thinks investing in STEM education alone will lead to innovation and economic growth, we need to lead by example and invest in rebuilding a government engineering and science workforce and supporting a national research workforce.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I am a Smith. Worse I am a David Smith. There are a few of us, so there is a need for some disambiguation. Firstly, I am not Sir David Smith, the former secretary to the Governor-General. Sir David lives in a suburb near mine, and his epistles to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Canberra Times</span> supporting the monarchy confused acquaintances of mine. For the record, I firmly support an Australian republic with a head of state that is one of us. Our sons and daughters across the capital region, and across the country should not be denied the opportunity to aspire to positions of public service on the basis of birthright, religion or gender.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also important to distinguish me from other David Smiths in the labour movement. When the news broke that I had become the new senator for the ACT I was variously described as a union hack or a union boss. Much as I might have liked to have thought my role in Professionals Australia led to the latter description, it was a confusion between me and the National Secretary of the Australian Services Union, David Smith. Fortunately <span style="font-style:italic;">The Canberra Times</span> did not also confuse me with David Smith, the AMWU National Vehicle Division Secretary.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I will settle for union hack, though, if what that means is working with and for working people and their families in their workplaces at industry level for the last 14 years and if it means acting as a comfort when things go wrong, advocating against rising inequality, and making the case that all working people should be treated with dignity and respect. Pope John Paul II famously stated that unions were an 'indispensable element of social life' and 'advocates for the struggle for social justice, for the just rights of working people'. This is a struggle that we are engaged in now: the undermining of collective bargaining, the restrictions on union representation and activity, and the deterioration in the rights and conditions of working people across their country. We need to change the rules; we need a Shorten Labor government.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many people I need to thank for the support that they have provided me on this journey—my blood brothers Daniel and Stuart. We started our Labor journeys together at school and continue them today. I can only hope to live up to the standards that you have both set. And thanks to those friends and family that we have bored to tears with our obsession but who have supported us nonetheless. It brings me joy to see many of you here today.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">It wasn't hard to be inspired to make a difference in a local Labor Party that included Terry Higgins, Ros Kelly, Terry Connolly, Bob McMullan and many others. I am particularly indebted to Paul Whalan, Don McCallum, John Hargreaves and Craig Simmons and the cohort of comrades that joined around the same time as me. I have met so many good people on the way from the beginning in 1990 to now.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Public Service I was lucky to learn from a strong group of Public Service leaders that believed that serving the government of the day didn't mean leaving your ethics and values at the door, including Paddy Gourley, James Smythe, Bernie Yates and Kate Bosser. And I worked for senior managers that treated their employees with care and decency. Their example is one which could be the basis for rebuilding faith in public service leadership.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">For the last 14 years I have worked in the labour movement with the Australian Federal Police Association and Professionals Australia. It was an honour to work alongside Jon, Mark and Craig and the many delegates and members in that remarkably diverse, challenging and complex organisation—the Australian Federal Police.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In my 10 years with Professionals Australia I have worked with great people across our membership, within the union and across other unions. In Chris Walton, I had as a mentor one of the great, thoughtful, caring labour movement leaders. Chris always made us think about the essential value and contribution our members made to making our communities better, but this could only work well when they worked together. He helped me balance work with the challenges presented by changes in life, particularly juggling family commitments with young children and then the challenges caused by my father's deteriorating health. I also owe a debt to all my colleagues in Professionals Australia, particularly those that have worked with me in the ACT. The work we did was nothing, though, without the amazing work of our delegates and members across all our workplaces—a job that is getting harder in an unnecessarily adversarial industrial relations environment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Across the labour movement there are too many to name, but I must mention Neville Betts, Athol Williams, Bev Turello and Mike Nicolaides.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish to particularly acknowledge my staff: Chris, Kim, Karl, Nick, Mikey and Bryce. They have made a significant sacrifice, understanding that their decision to join me is at an uncertain time. In these last few weeks they have gone above and beyond in a challenging environment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank you and want to remind you that I am a North Melbourne supporter. 'Shinboners' fight, and I will fight!</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I could not be here without the support of my family and friends, but in particular I could not be here without the support of my immediate family: Liesl, Marcus, Eamonn and Stella.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Marcus, Eamonn and Stella make us immensely proud. Our focus group of a 14-, 12- and nine-year-old is invaluable. It is amazing how often children see things more clearly than we do.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Coming to Liesl Maria Centenera. I met Liesl in the late nineties in the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations. The first time we met I thought I had made a good impression. I was wrong. However, time and maybe persistence changed that view. We shared similar values about the importance of family and community, fairness in the world of work and commitment to making a difference. And to make a difference, sometimes sacrifices have to be made and opportunities deferred. While in the United Kingdom, I worked for Slough Borough Council while Liesl was the chief legal counsel for the Commission for Racial Equality. In returning to Australia, while we both worked part time to better balance our growing family, the truth is that Liesl always lifted the heavier load. During the time Liesl was a senior executive in ACT government and I held senior roles in the local labour movement, we ensured there were no conflicts of interest in relation to the issues for which we had responsibility. Integrity is fundamental to good public life. To support my decision to run in 2016 and then be placed to serve in this chamber, Liesl stepped away from her Public Service job and instead threw herself into community and family life. I could not take this opportunity without the support of the smartest, most loyal and decent person I know. I look forward to the time when I can do the same for Liesl.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I did not expect to be provided with the opportunity to serve the people of the ACT in this chamber, but it is an opportunity I take seriously for there is work to be done.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to leave you with the final public words of another Smith, John Smith, the former leader of the UK Labour Party, a man who would have been likely to be Prime Minister if it were not for his untimely death: 'The opportunity to serve—that is all we ask.'</span>

                  <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The PRESIDENT:</span>  The suspension motion, if carried, is to literally put the motion as a formal motion.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator WONG:</span>
                  </a>  Without amendment or debate—thank you. Well, I rise to speak against the suspension of standing orders, and I'm pleased that you, Mr President, clarified that the government is proposing to support the suspension of standing orders to enable this motion to be voted on without debate or amendment. That is a very unfortunate position that the government has taken and one that I would respectfully suggest that the government may come to regret.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have, since 1998, in this place avoided having this kind of debate—that is, a straight up-or-down vote—on matters of foreign policy for very sound reasons. Senator Faulkner in May 1998 articulated the position very clearly: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In cases where there is not unanimous agreement on such a motion, the Labor Party will not be agreeing to formality. We take the view that foreign policy motions should not be decided without debate. We believe that formal motions are not an appropriate instrument for formulating or conveying positions on foreign policy. They are a blunt instrument. Senators may either support them in the form in which they are put before the Senate or oppose them. They may not amend them. The nuances and subtleties of foreign policy issues and the impact on Australia's relations with other countries needs to be carefully considered and debated, and the procedures for formal motions in our view preclude such important considerations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why consistently this opposition has behaved very responsibly and voted with the government on a number of occasions, even in relation to motions where we may have been far closer to supporting the content of the motion than the government, but we have respected a convention that has been operating in this place since well before I came here and well before a number of us came here—that is, since 1998.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, for some reason the government have decided that they are going to walk away from this today. They are going to walk away from the convention whereby both parties of government recognise that having the Australian Senate vote without amendment or debate on matters of foreign policy is not in the national interest, that external parties, other nations, other entities obviously receive the information of the Senate resolving something and give that a great deal of weight. And senators in this place are not enabled to properly debate nor amend motions so that they reflect the different nuances of views around the chamber in relation to foreign policy. You don't do foreign policy in a tick-a-box way, and that is what formal motions enable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have been responsible as an opposition. In the period certainly since I've been in this place, this has always been the approach taken. Now, on this occasion, the government have decided that they are willing to suspend standing orders to enable this motion to be resolved—more importantly and relevantly, without amendment or debate. This is a very, very poor step by the government. If this is the precedent followed, it will mean that motions moved by the Australian Greens on highly controversial matters would be voted on without amendment or debate. I would say to the government that it is not in the national interest for Australian foreign policy issues to be dealt with in this way and, frankly, to be used for the purposes of pressing a political issue domestically.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been occasions on which Labor people have supported a denial of formality on motions that I think many people might have been inclined to support. But we have held the discipline of recognising that this chamber ought not deal with matters of foreign policy in the way of this procedure that the government is now supporting. The chamber should not do so. I would say to the government that you should really consider whether or not this is a sensible way for you to approach these matters. This is a poor precedent, and it is a precedent that I suspect foreign minister Julie Bishop will not be pleased with down the track when she sees what the consequences of removing this convention are. It will mean that motions that cause the portfolio and the government concerns could be debated and resolved in this chamber, and that is not a good thing. </span>

You know the process we go through—we read through these things every night, trying to understand all of the points that ground the motion. It's just a very, very difficult thing to do in one page. There are many other ways in which we can express our concerns and explore issues, including references to the foreign affairs, defence and trade committees. I'm not seeking to stop you raising those issues, but I agree that motions are a poor method to deal with the complex issues.</span>

                  <a href="273829" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ANNING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:44</span>):  This is not my first speech. I rise to speak on the ongoing issue of rural lending practices. The financial system plays a key role in supporting sustainable economic growth and meeting the financial needs of all Australians. The strength of our system in the past has rested on the pillars of strict prudential supervision, world's best practice and the trust of consumers knowing they will be treated fairly. Fair treatment is when a consumer engages the services of a firm or an individual and the participants act with integrity and transparency. Overwhelmingly, Australians would expect this to be the case. Unfortunately, the reality is that integrity, transparency and treating a customer with dignity have come a poor second to the rich pickings of farmers' assets ripe for the taking. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission was hard won, with many of my colleagues having to fight tooth and nail for a number of years before finally getting it across the line. To date, there have been almost 7,000 submissions detailing threats of foreclosure. I've even heard of an incident where a bank manager urged suicide. And there have been many other, often tragic, results of unscrupulous actions. It's disappointing it has taken so long for these horrendous issues to come to light. In fact, it would seem that we are only just scratching the surface of this problem. While I know a lot of good will come out of the royal commission, in its current form there are issues in relation to time, funding and lack of political will. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What has been brought to light already is, seemingly, systemic abuse by the financial sector of some of our most vulnerable in rural areas. Take a minute to consider some of the tactics that have been employed. There are anticipatory breaches of contract. For instance, farmers may never have missed a payment, yet, because the bank thinks they may in the future, it'll come in and sell them up. If the family homes of urban residents were sold up just because the banks thought people may breach their contracts in the future, there would be outrage. The prospect of banks putting mum, dad and the kids on the street because of something that may never happen would cause a revolt. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This isn't the worst of it. Lee Wallace had a successful grey and red Brahman stud. He had not, at any point, defaulted on his loan. However, for reasons that were not disclosed, the bank called in the loan. Within a year, $14 million of assets and $5.6 million of debt turned into no assets and more than a million dollars in debt. In the case of Prairie grazier Debbie Viney, during a drought her bank manager told her not to sell cattle, despite that being their drought strategy. How is it that someone with no experience in running a cattle place can make key business decisions? Debbie was forced to keep the cattle, which continued to lose condition and they started dying. A year later, the bank allowed them to be sold, but as a result of the drought conditions most had starved to death and the rest had been put down. I could name many more cases, but we would be here all day. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge the comments made this week by Ms Orr in relation to receivers and where they fit in the spectrum of the royal commission, but you have to look at its very intent. The intent of the royal commission was to address the unconscionable banking practices within the finance sector. In the current form, it is restricted in its ability to do this. The terms of reference need to be expanded to include the behaviour of receivers and their agents. The issue of receivers' behaviour has been identified as a source of grave concern and has been linked to a wave of suicides. This toxic culture has affected and continues to affect many within our rural communities—our friends, our neighbours and our families, my own family included. My brother-in-law lost his family properties, Runnymede and Red Rock, in 2011. Runnymede had been the family home for almost a century. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unconscionable rural lending practices are having a devastating effect on rural communities and agricultural production in this country. The waves of debt-driven suicides are a clarion call to action by those who lead the country. Fairness and a fair go are ingrained in the Australian psyche but have been notable by their absence in the treatment our farmers have received. Let us ensure that this is not repeated and that those who feed us are given the justice they deserve. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="247871" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'SULLIVAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:49</span>):  Well, indeed, might I congratulate Senator Anning on choosing the subject matter for this MPI and endorse the fact that it is a matter of public importance. I'd like to attach myself to his remarks in his contribution. It's well known that I was involved in agitating, along with yourself, Mr Acting Deputy President Williams, might I say, and with others in the other place, for a commission of inquiry, which resulted in this current royal commission. I'm inclined to agree that the terms of reference could have been broader in some categories. Of course, my motive all the way through—and I know your motive, Mr Acting Deputy President—had a focus on the importance of this inquiry for people in the rural sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that you've dealt with, quite literally, hundreds of representations over time. I, myself, in the four years that I've been here, have at the very least been engaged with rural producers who found themselves in difficulty. That's been in the many dozens. I really do want to place on the record your efforts, Mr Acting Deputy President, because I know that there are quite literally dozens and dozens of families who survived their conflict with the banks due to your representations to the banking sector. In fact, I suspect that outside the Prime Minister and perhaps the finance minister and the Treasurer, you are the only one who's got all the CEOs of the banks on speed dial! And I know from my experience that you didn't hesitate to push the button. That, in a sense, lent confidence to people in the bush—they knew that they had a champion in this place with respect to the behaviour of the banks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to focus just on two parts. I've said it in speeches in this place before, and outside of this place, that one of the most unconscionable efforts of the banks had to do with the establishment of securities. It was the term for it, as you know. When a loan is made, two of the critical considerations for a lender are to do with serviceability—clearly, that's the ability of the borrower to meet the terms and requirements of their loan. And the second is a matter of security. And there's a thing called an LVR: the loan-to-value ratio. Whilst there are always exceptions to the rule, in the rural sector that floats somewhere between 60 per cent and 75 per cent, depending on the terms of the application. What that means is that a financial institution will lend the borrower up to 60 per cent, or between 60 per cent and 75 per cent, of the total value of the purchase, with the balance being the equity of the investor—the equity of the farmer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a well-known fact to anyone who studies trends in rural assets that the fortunes of the borrower rest, first of all, with the weather. Second is the market itself—the implications of the market itself. And thirdly, of course, is the value of the property. There is a direct relationship. If you overlay the graphs of these things over 30 years, it is absolutely uncanny how these trends occur. Bad weather conditions are not favourable to the farmer so there are bad market conditions as a result, with the saturation of commodities onto the market. Of course that then puts downward pressure on the value of the asset.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This LVR, the loan-to-value ratio part of it, is one of the covenants. There are many covenants in a loan contract between the lender and the borrower, but this is one of the critical covenants. If it's breached—that is to say that if at any given time the value of the property is such that the equity, or the share of equity, of the value of the property is less than that in the contract—it gives the banks carte blanche to be able to take control of the asset.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike most of us in this place, and most who live in the heavily populated areas of the country, the unique thing about rural producers is that everything's on the line. It's not just their business; it's their house, where they live. Every single asset that they own is attached, in most instances, to the security of the loan on their property. Unlike businesses, who might find themselves in trouble where the bank might foreclose on a business, where they've got opportunities—and many, many hundreds of thousands of businesspeople do this—they separate the assets so that, in the event of a failure, they might at least preserve the family home and they might at least preserve the tools of their trade. They might lose the business and, in circumstances where the contracts are not met, that's not an unfair or an unreasonable thing to occur. But they're unlikely at any time—certainly not during a drought, if you're a borrower in the metropolitan areas—to have the value of their business asset, unless it's directly indexed into the supplying goods or services into the rural sector, impact on their home or assets that are isolated from the security arrangements with the bank. The banks have used this on frequent occasions, and recent evidence before the commission shows that they used this as a trigger to take over so many properties.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second part—and Senator Anning was right to raise it—is what happens when the banks move on these properties. The banks know full well that, with a break in the season, there will come a lift in commodity prices and a restoration of the value of the property, but they're not interested in waiting for that. At the worst possible time in the farmer's or the pastoralist's life, in circumstances beyond their control—there's very little they can do to mitigate their circumstances from a long and cruel drought—when they need their banks the most, it's their experience that they receive the least amount of support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Acting Deputy President Williams, I know that you've had a number of cases presented to you around the appointment of receivers and administrators. I know there was one famous case that came to you where the receivers moved stock off the property. There was some contestability around the transporting of the stock, and it was $16,000 or $17,000 when it should have been $6,000 or $7,000. These people have no idea. They undo their tie, take their crisp white shirt and fluff the collar and then go out into the west to take on a role to manage a complex circumstance of properties that are in drought. They honestly would not know the difference between a mulga bush and a Christmas tree, and yet they're sent in to try and keep thousands of stock alive. They buy in a bit of cheap labour along the way. But what happens—and this is the insidious aspect of what happens—is: I promise you, to an appointment, that they will stay in the appointment and not resolve the matter until they have carved out every cent of equity left by that farming family. Sometimes it takes 12 or 18 months to administer the receiving of the property, and they will just go until there's absolutely nothing left. So, not only have these people lost everything; they've also lost the opportunity to make a dignified transition off their farms to some other form of life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The banks are on notice. They know they're on notice. They need to think very, very carefully. Some of the ways that they will be able to restore public confidence are: to look at some of the features of these loans; to look at some of the features around these weather cycles; and to have a look at what periods these properties are in good shape, in the sense that people can then make prudential provisions and arrangements with their banks in order to be ready to insulate themselves from the inevitable dry period in this country. I could quote from a dozen Lawson and Paterson poems about the circumstances on the land. The banks can't pretend that they're ignorant to these cycles and the challenges of these borrowers. Mr Acting Deputy President Williams, I know that you are looking at this very closely. I am looking at this very closely. We need, as a government and as a parliament, to support this inquiry, if it requires more time and more resources, until it does this job very, very thoroughly.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="244247" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KETTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:59</span>):  I too am indebted to Senator Anning for raising this issue as a matter of public importance. I'll talk a bit about the royal commission, but I do think it is appropriate to make the point that it is not for us to make a running commentary on the progress of the royal commission. It was a hard fight to get this royal commission. It's been established in circumstances which perhaps were not ideal. If Labor had been in government, things might have been done differently in terms of the establishment of the royal commission. But now that it is in place it should be allowed to do the important work that it has before it, and I certainly wish the commissioner well in those proceedings. Mr Acting Deputy President Williams, I acknowledge your advocacy for this royal commission. I understand that many small business people, consumers and farmers have expressed concerns in relation to their treatment at the hands of some of our major financial institutions and the ethical and cultural practices within these institutions. A royal commission has been long overdue but is now underway. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's important to go back to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services inquiry into the impairment of customer loans. It was referred back in 2015 and there was a report in the first half of 2016. I participated in that inquiry. We heard a number of horrific stories about the way farmers were treated at the hands of banks at a time when they were most vulnerable—when we were experiencing drought conditions, particularly in my home state of Queensland. We saw how this played out post GFC with the Commonwealth Bank's acquisition of Bankwest and ANZ's acquisition of Landmark. The Landmark matter has come up in the royal commission's proceedings so far. But we did deal with the Landmark matter in the impairment of customer loans inquiry, and the committee noted in its report that ANZ, without admission of regulatory breach, admitted they had to significantly improve the financial circumstances of some of the customers with whom they have been in dispute. So ANZ did, by implication, recognise that the extant system of checks and balances was inadequate to protect small business customers and ensure a fair and transparent relationship with the bank.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By and large the Labor participants in that inquiry supported the ultimate recommendations. However, we differed from the majority view in one major respect, and that was that we did not agree with the finding that there should not be a royal commission. We found that there was a persistent pattern of abuse arising from the asymmetry of power in the relationship between lender and borrower, and we did not agree that the evidence received was sufficient to conclude that there was no widespread or systemic illegal or unethical behaviour by the banks. So we believed that there was evidence of banking misconduct that needed to be further investigated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was at that point that the dissenting Labor participants in that inquiry came out with our recommendation that a royal commission be established to examine the banking and financial sector. What we talked about was that we wanted in particular to look at the widespread instances of illegal and unethical behaviour within Australia's financial services industry; how Australia's financial services institutions treat their duty of care to their customers; how the culture, ethical standards and business structures of Australian financial services institutions affect the behaviour of these institutions; and whether Australia's regulators are equipped to prevent illegal and unethical behaviour. We wanted to look at comparable international experience and any other events that came up in the course of those investigations. I think we were on the money then. But I note, Mr Acting Deputy President, that you had come out earlier than that, and you should rightly claim some credit for that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission has continued to uncover scandals which amaze us and are really a disgrace. We expect that the findings of the royal commission in the report ultimately will do some justice to the problems that have been highlighted so that we can see some fundamental reform occurring.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen the ANZ expansion into agribusiness. It has come out that, it appears, they simply weren't ready for the Landmark customers and that, as a result, 162 farmers were forced from their land. This is, as I say, an issue that came up in our PJC.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We read, in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sydney Morning Herald</span> on 25 June, of concerns that banks were changing loan contracts for rural customers and deeming them a financial risk even if they'd never missed a payment—and Senator O'Sullivan has touched on some of these covenants and the devices used by the banks to find their customers in default, even though there was no financial default occurring. They used other things such as the loan-to-value ratio or the non-provision of reports et cetera. Last Friday, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review</span> reported the heartbreaking story of the Ballabay Station owners in north-west Central Queensland who were evicted from their home, which was their only livelihood, by the police at the direction of the agricultural lender Rabobank. There are very many stories like that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are stories about rural properties being sold for half their original worth in times of drought. I know that I expressed some concerns about the behaviour of valuers, and I am concerned about the inherent conflict of interest that exists with the profession of valuers and the problem with major banks having panels of valuers and the inevitable conflicts that occur as a result of that. I think that's an issue that warrants further scrutiny into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was because Labor listened to these stories and we were concerned about rural lending practices that we called for the royal commission. It is regrettable—and I use that word 'regrettable', because it is regrettable that the Prime Minister took so long to announce the royal commission, but, even when he did, he indicated that the decision was regrettable. Again, that is an instance of how out of touch the Prime Minister is with the concerns of ordinary Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, in the whole of this process, the National Party—apart from you, Mr Acting Deputy President Williams—did not stand up for their constituency, and they allowed the Liberals to write the terms of reference. As I said at the outset, the terms of reference are not those which we probably would have supported. But let's just get on with the issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a lack of consultation on those terms of reference, which would've been better handled if the victims had been consulted. In fact, it would've been, probably, advisable for ASIC to have been informed and to have had an input into those terms of reference. But that didn't happen, because we know that the banks came out one morning at about 8.30, in writing, to indicate that they now supported a royal commission, and it was something like an hour later that the Prime Minister did one of the most enormous backflips in political history, by coming out and indicating that a royal commission would be conducted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we do have to have confidence in the process. As I say, I think we can see in the daily news what's coming out of the royal commission. And it is definitely an eye-opener.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, Labor has led the way on financial reform, and we have led the way on the Future of Financial Advice reforms, which those on the other side have voted against, and when it comes to superannuation and payday lending laws. While our arrogant and out-of-touch Prime Minister prioritises tax cuts for the top end of town at the expense of health and education and at the expense of regional Australia, we, on this side of the chamber, are standing up for rural communities and the issues that they are experiencing. Labor will continue to listen to regional and rural communities.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:09</span>):  As you are all aware, One Nation spearheaded a very successful Senate inquiry into this very matter. It was evidence uncovered by this inquiry into the banks' rural lending practices that forced the government to finally hold this long-overdue royal commission. Only the other week, my fellow One Nation senator Peter Georgiou and I stood outside the royal commission and called for the royal commission's investigation to be expanded. So I'm proud of One Nation's consistency on this issue and our record of holding the banks to account.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now that the banking royal commission has started, we see the horrors of what the bankers have been doing. This is not the behaviour we would expect from people trusted with the wealth of millions of Australians. It was the Australian taxpayers effectively who bailed out the banking system with the $250,000 deposit guarantee. In return, Australians have had to endure a continuous procession of unethical and illegal behaviour from a rotten bank executive culture.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe the Hayne commission has done a good job of investigating misconduct where the banks have already admitted fault, like financial planning, insurance and fees for no service. However, for misconduct where the banks have not admitted fault, the commission has been found wanting. I have grave concerns about two key points where the Hayne commission has failed. Firstly, there are masses of farmers who want to tell Australia their horror stories. I have personally spoken to dozens of these farming victims. These people want their say. These people want to be heard. Their stories are so horrific that all Australians need to hear them so that we, as a community, can decide on what we should do with banking executives that treat families like this. In my opinion, there has not been sufficient time given to hearing the array of stories from farm victims.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, and of most concern, was the manner in which the Hayne commission glossed over the small business scandals, especially the CBA takeover of Bankwest. It is especially disconcerting given that the CBA Bankwest misconduct is identical to the ANZ Landmark misconduct. Both scandals involved the bank destroying or attempting to destroy the customers' livelihoods. This has caused the breakup of families, mental and physical illness and, in some cases, suicide. The Hayne commission investigates the ANZ Landmark mistreatment of farmers but dismisses the CBA Bankwest mistreatment of SMEs as a conspiracy theory. Something is amiss. I hope that the commissioner slows down, reads all the evidence, speaks to all the witnesses and asks for more time from the government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on the government to extend the funding, time frame and terms of reference to include receivers, liquidators, administrators and mortgage insurance for the banking royal commission so that farmers and SMEs can get justice and legislatures can make sure no Australian ever has to suffer through this mistreatment at the hands of banks. I'm also calling on the government to pass the cost of the royal commission on to the banking and financial services sectors found guilty misconduct, and the victims paid adequate compensation for their loss and pain.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator IAN MACDONALD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:13</span>):  First, I thank Senator Anning for raising this issue—a very, very topical and important issue, particularly with the royal commission going on and some of the stories that have been coming out. Following Senator Hanson, I might say that her comments about the Commonwealth Bank and Bankwest are very, very accurate. I remember when the Commonwealth Bank took over Bankwest. Bankwest had some horrific banking propositions, particularly up in gulf country of north-west Queensland. I well remember some of the very dodgy, you'd almost say, banking deals that happened when the inevitable drought came in the gulf country—as they always will, in cycles—and the attitude of Bankwest. At the same time as this was happening, the Commonwealth Bank took over, and it was very difficult to get a sympathetic hearing. I personally know some people in that gulf country of Queensland who were victims of some very, very questionable banking practices at the time involving the particular banks that Senator Hanson was talking about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Acting Deputy President Williams, before I proceed further with my contribution today, I want to pay tribute to you for your relentless and long-term campaign to bring the banks to account. I know from history that you've had some personal experience in years gone by, and I do remember the very, very substantial assistance you gave to people, including some constituents of mine. When I was at a bit of a loss to understand how to help them, I got them to speak with you, and they are forever grateful, then and today, for your contribution and the way you assisted them and brought the banks to account.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="AI6" type="MemberInterjecting">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">Senator Cameron:</span>
                  </a>  When they did Wacka over, it was a bad decision!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="YW4" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator IAN MACDONALD:</span>
                  </a>  Yes, indeed. But it wasn't just personal for Senator Williams—and I take your interjection, Senator Cameron. Senator Williams understood, perhaps better than most of us, some of the banking practices, but he was also concerned about people and wanted to help them as best he could.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, I pay tribute to my Queensland colleague Senator O'Sullivan, who took the gamble of incurring the ire of the powers that be to be very forceful and open about the banking royal commission and what the government's approach to it should be. I know that, to a degree, it was the work that both Senator O'Sullivan and Senator Williams did within the coalition that changed some previously held attitudes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having said that, I can indicate that, since coming to office in 2013, the coalition government has delivered the most ambitious reform agenda for the financial system in recent history. We have a commitment to a strong and stable financial sector, and that started with the Murray inquiry into the financial system, which, as one might remember, regrettably wasn't supported by Labor at the time. Chris Bowen, the then Treasurer, said: 'The financial system is strong, well regulated and well managed, and I have not seen a case for a full-blown inquiry.' Fortunately, the Murray inquiry did go ahead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we've proactively sought to reform the Australian financial sector, unfortunately our opponents in this chamber have sat idle, contributing nothing more than a running commentary from the sidelines. Many of the notable scandals and collapses in financial services, such as Trio Capital, Great Southern and Storm Financial, happened on Labor's watch, when the current Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten, was the minister responsible for financial services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased that the government has contributed to establishing a sensible, well-resourced and targeted royal commission to identify areas of misconduct and to ensure that the recently announced legislative reforms will provide adequate protection to consumers well into the future. It is important that the royal commission does its job for the Australian people, and it is doing that. It's uncovering instances of serious wrongdoing and shining a light on them. No doubt the royal commission will make recommendations to the government, if the royal commission believes that changes to the law are necessary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having said all of that, Australia, of course, has one of the strongest and most stable banking, superannuation and financial services industries in the world. But the Turnbull government will continue its critical reform agenda, including seeing what the royal commission says and then taking meaningful action, as we've shown in the past we can.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I finish, I just want to briefly mention the legislation promoted by this government for the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, which has introduced a one-stop shop dispute resolution scheme to provide consumers with independent and timely access to justice, and access to compensation where appropriate. I particularly want to mention the Australian Financial Complaints Authority will operate under significantly increased monetary limits and compensation caps. The bit that I particularly like is that small business primary producers who are in dispute with their lenders may be awarded up to $2 million in compensation, and that's around six times what is currently available. So that's just one of the initiatives the current government has taken, and I can assure the Senate that the government will be watching closely the recommendations of the royal commission and, as required, it will be taking legislative or other action that might be needed and recommended.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="122087" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McCARTHY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:20</span>):  I rise to speak on today's matter of public importance. The Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry has started to turn its attention to the long-suffering plight of those farmers and primary producers treated unfairly, those in debt due to circumstances well beyond their control.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Turnbull government didn't want this inquiry to proceed, and they certainly did everything they could to protect their mates in big business. They did everything they could to help their mates working for the big banks. And let's not forget that the only reason the Prime Minister relented and called this inquiry was because the banks asked him to do so. It wasn't pressure from Labor, pressure from his own party room or pressure from the parliament—or even pressure from the people—that got him to change his mind; it was a request from the banks themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor from the outset has been critical of the banks, and rightly so. Time and time again we hear stories of heartache and stories of loss, both financial and personal. This Senate in particular, as well as the Senate of the previous parliament, can hold its head up high for leading the charge to help shine a light on the unconscionable conduct of the banks. In particular, I draw reference to the Senate Economics References Committee report into forestry managed investment schemes. These investment practises were particularly detrimental to farmers. Some farmers, who leased their land to MISs, suffered massive financial loss from failed MISs. It was difficult for them to seek clarity on their legal position with regard to ownership rights over land and trees, and liability for damage. The administration and liquidation of MISs gave rise to a number of difficulties, again associated with ownership rights, but also with conflicts of interest. And when they reached out for help, this government turned them away.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People want justice, whether it is through this royal commission or through the litany of inquiries conducted by the Senate, and they deserve it. At the time of the publication of the Senate report into forestry managed investment schemes, ANZ, through its association with Timbercorp, set up hardship funds for investors, but it was hardly compensation. It's also worth noting that stories like these are not isolated incidents; they are systemic, which is why this royal commission is so vital.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only yesterday, throughout the commission's hearings in Brisbane, we heard the story of the Harleys. Stephen Harley had just suffered a heart attack when ANZ ruthlessly pursued his family for the default of a loan, saying they had to pay off their entire debt by March 2014 and that, if they didn't, they'd have just one day to leave their beloved farm. And even worse, this correspondence was received despite Stephen's wife, Janine, informing the bank that her husband had been flown to Perth for heart surgery. She wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I hope you can now understand the pressure we’ve been under … we ask that this is taken under consideration when a decision is made.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Harleys are just one story of many farmers who have been relentlessly hounded by the banks, mostly due to circumstances beyond their control, such as previous financiers having their agribusiness books acquired by banks like ANZ.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Harleys managed to sell five of their nine land lots and livestock to pay down $1.6 million of the $2.5 million debt before the March 2014 deadline. However, because the bank refused to accept the circumstances they faced due to the heart attack of Stephen, they were forced to sell the four remaining parts of their farm, but these lots were sold by the bank. However, they were sold for $570,000 less than they were valued at, and at a much lower value than that at which the Harleys had sold the first five lots. Eventually, in July 2017, the bank decided it would not pursue the remaining $309,000 that the Harleys owed. When asked why it took so long to inform them, despite knowledge of Stephen Harley's heart condition, ANZ executive Ben Steinberg replied, 'I don't know.' He conceded that if the Harleys had asked for that nine-month extension today it would more likely have been granted. This is too little too late.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The behaviour of the banks and their inability to show compassion towards farmers—or anyone else, for that matter—existed long before these stories. Back in 2016, at the height of the CommInsure scandal, James Kessel, a former cotton picker and diesel mechanic, suffered a massive heart attack. He thought his road to recovery would be aided by his personal life insurance. It wasn't. His understanding was that his cover allowed him to claim up to $1 million in compensation. However, they had different ideas. Essentially, they claimed that its definition of a heart attack had not been met by the events that occurred in Mr Kessel's case and instead relied on an old, outdated definition to determine the severity of a heart attack. That was the claim from the insurer. Seriously, banks, financial advisers and CEOs should not be deciding what the definition of a heart attack is. That should be reserved for medical professionals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To take another example, let's have a look at the powers. This government has since 2016 been promising laws to give ASIC important powers to crack down on dodgy payday lending practices and dodgy rent-to-buy schemes. To date it has failed to introduce this legislation. The delay is hurting families who are preyed upon by unscrupulous lenders. At the latest estimates, in May, Treasury officials couldn't provide an answer about when this vital legislation would be introduced. All they could say was that it was a matter for government. Claims that these loans help people to get out of hardship ignore the fact that the cost of a payday loan is itself a significant financial burden for a person on a low income. You could say that a low-income earner who is trapped in a debt cycle has effectively taken a pay cut, courtesy of their payday lender. A $300 payday loan typically requires a $372 repayment after 28 days. Given such a high repayment, it should be no surprise that a low-income borrower will borrow again to meet a further shortfall caused by the cost of the loan itself. This is how payday loans trap Australians into an ongoing debt cycle. Far from assisting them to overcome financial hardship, payday loans perpetuate hardship, and a high proportion of payday loan borrowers—almost 25 per cent, at last count—are Centrelink recipients. As such, many borrowers are committing a significant proportion of their welfare payment towards repaying payday loans. Many payday lenders target First Nations families and their communities, perpetuating financial hardship in many cases.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope the royal commission into misconduct in the banking and financial services industry has prompted financial sector institutions and advocates to reflect on the effectiveness and impact of lending practices. I hope it prompts this government to finally take action on some of the irresponsible lending practices that are rife across our communities. The royal commission sits in Darwin this month, and I suspect that we will be hearing more stories of the hardship and trauma that these unconscionable practices are causing for the people of the Territory. All I can say is that whatever recommendations come out of this royal commission—be it for farmers, be it for small business owners, be it for those who have received dodgy financial advice or be it for those on low incomes, deliberately targeted by unscrupulous lenders—it had better be a matter for government, because this government does owe all these people an apology.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:29</span>):  The royal commission is the biggest thing in town, and I feel very strongly that the ramifications of this royal commission are going to be felt for a generation. I'm confident that the commission is doing a great job and that we will see some recommendations that we can drive home.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to say, Mr Acting Deputy President Williams, while you're sitting in the chair, that when you leave this place, you can hold your head high for what you did to make sure this royal commission happened. We're hearing a lot of commentary and a lot of claiming about the royal commission. I would say that while a number of people in this chamber and the other place helped make it happen, and some important people outside of this chamber—investigative journalists and whistleblowers—also helped make it happen, without yourself and the Greens, it wouldn't have happened.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator WHISH-WILSON:</span>
                  </a>  I knew you might arc up, Senator Cameron. I'm very glad that you did. Let me explain why. Senator Williams and I were both on the original inquiry with Senator Mark Bishop when we decided to call for a royal commission. Unfortunately, the final committee report didn't reflect that clearly, and Senator Bishop personally would have liked to have seen a royal commission. But the Greens were the first party in 2014 to call for a royal commission. We were the first party to campaign for a royal commission, relentlessly. It took us nearly two years, but we did eventually get Labor on board going into the double-dissolution election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's plenty of other water under that bridge for another time, but I'd like to say that it was the Greens that created the Trojan Horse, the legislation for a parliamentary commission of inquiry. It was our idea and our legislation which passed this place. It was my private senator's bill that was sent to the other place that enabled the pressure to be brought to bear on the Prime Minister and the banks to actually call a royal commission. If it hadn't been for that legislation—and I thank One Nation and all the senators who supported it—it would never have happened. Once again, there'll be plenty of time to tell the story of the long and winding road to the royal commission at another date, but I think parliament can hold its head high that it did a really good job to try and get this scrutiny of our financial services sector. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The logic to me was always very simple. As a senator, I saw the Senate inquiry processes, the numerous inquiries we all sat on—those of us on the economics committee—and the Senate could never get to the bottom of these issues. We simply didn't use our powers or weren't prepared to use our powers. We certainly didn't have the resources. As good as our people are in the committee system, we could never get to the bottom of it. Even the CommBank inquiry or the ASIC inquiry or the inquiry into forestry management investment schemes or inquiries into financial misconduct—we could never get to the bottom of these issues. All we got were platitudes from executives. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the limitations of the political process in the Senate, we were never going to get justice for victims or get substantive legislative change. However, the pressure on the Liberal government to call for a royal commission did lead to some good legislative outcomes in this country in the last few years. Minister O'Dwyer, Mr Scott Morrison and a number of ministers brought legislation to this place to try and improve things, but it was never going to be enough. We actually needed a QC who knew what he or she was doing with the powers and with the resources and with the time to get to the bottom of these issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am concerned that the time frame is too short and that not enough will be done. That's another bridge we can get to when we arrive at it. But I'm very proud to stand in here in this chamber and say today that I was part of something much bigger than myself, much bigger even than our political parties and this institution of the Senate. We've managed to get what I believe will be a far-reaching royal commission into financial services at a time when it was desperately needed. That's all I'll have to say today, but, no doubt, I'll have more to say about this in the future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:34</span>):  I begin by saying that the One Nation-led Senate inquiry into rural lending was the catalyst for the current banking royal commission. The One Nation-led inquiry uncovered unconscionable and dishonest conduct by banks and by receiver managers. We heard stories of farmers having their interest rates raised by up to 80 per cent, and receiver managers charging them over $500 an hour to act on their behalf. In one case, we heard testimony from a Western Australian farmer who had been charged over $500,000 just to sell his sheep and his grain crop, which were worth about the same value. The entire proceeds from the sale were taken by the bank's receivers. This is nothing short of legalised theft.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been over 17 government inquiries into bank misconduct recently, and concerns about misconduct and regulatory failures have been the common theme. When the One Nation-led Senate report was tabled last year, Pauline Hanson called for a banking royal commission. The Turnbull government rejected these calls, saying that a royal commission was not needed as they had acted to clean up the industry. I raised this issue in this chamber last November, asking Senator Brandis:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The unfortunate thing about this royal commission is that it appears the banks and the government have colluded to write the terms of reference, as they conveniently omit references to bank-appointed receiver managers, one of the most problematic areas. It is almost totally unregulated and subject to many damning reports. Last month, the banking royal commission devoted just two weeks to small business lending and foreclosures. This is inappropriate, given the issues raised in numerous past Senate inquiries, the magnitude of the misconduct and the complexity of the evidence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The commission heard stories of misconduct by bank-appointed receivers that raised serious concerns, yet these issues were not allowed to be considered as they fall outside the terms of reference. The Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman, Kate Carnell, has expressed dismay at the brief period allocated to small businesses. The same thing happened in Brisbane this week when cases of rural lending were heard, with more stories of unconscionable and dishonest bank-appointed receivers and agents falling outside the commission's terms of reference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The commission's terms of reference need to be amended. The government has lobbied us to agree to cuts in the company tax rate that would effectively give banks millions in extra revenue at the cost of the Australian taxpayer. Senator Brandis was concerned about the cost of this royal commission, and here we have the government proposing tax cuts that would give the banks far in excess of the cost of this commission. It is in the interests of the nation that banking misconduct be exposed, and that past and present executives be held accountable. The cost of doing this is insignificant in comparison to the economic benefit gained by having an honest financial system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on the government, firstly, to immediately extend the terms of reference for the banking royal commission to include receiver managers and bank-appointed agents, including valuers and independent accountants. Secondly, it should extend the time frame and funding for the royal commission in order to allow it to be more diligent and inquisitive in its investigation. If the government is serious about cleaning up the industry, it should agree to this. There is no justifiable reason not to. If the royal commission is to address the concerns of the many past inquiries, it must be given the powers to investigate and allowed significant time to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, I would like to thank everyone in the Senate for supporting and getting this royal commission up; you know who you are.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:39</span>):  I present the report of the Community Affairs References Committee on mitochondrial donation, together with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee. I move:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This committee report is very significant for members of our community, particularly those who are affected by mitochondrial disease. I'd like to take this opportunity to particularly thank the members of our community who made submissions to the inquiry and actually came to the hearing we had for this inquiry. They presented, in many cases, very deeply personal information that was distressing for them. The committee makes four recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report has five chapters and we go through an explanation of the disease. Perhaps some people in this chamber but also in the broader community don't know what mitochondrial disease is. In fact, I've got to admit that I knew very little about mitochondrial disease until we undertook this inquiry. Mitochondrial disease is caused by mitochondrial genes that have mutated. Mitochondrial disease has many distressing impacts on people. It can lead to the premature death of a child. Mitochondria are responsible for the energy in your cells. If they are not working properly, it means that parts of your body that require lots of energy are primarily affected. For example, it can affect your brain, your heart, your eyesight and your hearing. In fact, we heard of these impacts. For those affected by mitochondrial disease, it can affect the mitochondrial DNA or it can affect the nuclear DNA. Mitochondrial donation applies to the 50 per cent of mitochondrial disease that is caused by mutations on the mitochondrial DNA. Where it could be effective, two types of mitochondrial donation could occur. The bottom line is that you replace the mitochondria in a cell which has affected genes with a donor's mitochondria. The gene mutations in mitochondria are passed down matrilineally, which means that they're passed down from mothers to their children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to get to the recommendations. There are other speakers here. Senator Slade Brockman just came in and I'm sure will make a contribution. He actually initiated this inquiry, supported by Senator Di Natale and members of the ALP. It's important to note that he really was driving this. We made four recommendations. Recommendation 1 says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee notes the strong potential of mitochondrial donation to address the debilitating effects of inheriting mitochondrial disease. The committee recommends that public consultation be undertaken regarding the introduction of mitochondrial donation to Australian clinical practice. To facilitate this consultation, the committee further recommends the Australian Government prepare a consulation paper, including options for legislative change that would be required. The Minister for Health should seek advice from the National Health and Medical Research Council on the most appropriate timing and format for this consultation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, our committee report has five chapters. We deal with the basics in chapter 1, in terms of what mitochondria are, the nature of the disease and what the donation involves. Then we deal with living with mitochondrial disease. The name sends a message that we talk about what the impacts are of the disease. As I articulated, they're very dire. I should also note this disease can lead to the deaths of children. But the impact of the disease varies, and we had somebody talk to us about this. A person aged around 40 can suddenly be affected by stroke, because it affects the energy in your brain. We had evidence from somebody who lost their sight. And we had evidence from people who lost their hearing. So it has many different effects. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We talk about the science of mitochondrial donation. I'm won't go into the detail of that, other than to say it's quite technical and there are a number of techniques. And because there are a number of techniques, there are a number ways that legislation, for example, can be affected. It's very obvious, from the inquiry, that the cloning legislation would need to be amended to enable mitochondrial donation. We also talk about the ethics of mitochondrial donation, because it raises issues about what technique you use for mitochondrial donation—whether you use the maternal spindle technique or the pro-nuclear technique. The pro-nuclear technique involves the fertilisation of both cells and extracting the pro-nucleus of the cell where the mitochondria are being donated. This is why we make the recommendation that there needs to be public consultation on this. We also consider that while we undertook some public consultation there would be public consultation around the legislation that would need to be amended. We articulate in our report that there needs to be wider consultation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no doubt in my mind that this mitochondrial donation has a very strong potential for helping those families who are affected by mitochondrial DNA where the disease is inherited. There's no doubt in my mind that this has potential. But there are some things that need to occur if this type of donation technique is to occur. There is also no doubt in my mind that it would help affected people and those who have genetically linked children. It would certainly help. We heard many accounts of the debilitating impact of this disease and what it means to people who carry the genes and don't want to pass them on—women who don't want to pass this disease on to their children. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll leave it at that because I know others want to make a contribution. I would like to thank the secretariat, for their excellent work on this report, and my colleagues. We really worked very hard to reach a consensus position on this report, and I would like to acknowledge the generosity that everybody brought to the table in order to discuss this very important and, some would say, very delicate topic. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:49</span>):  I, too, rise to speak on the Community Affairs References Committee report into mitochondrial donation. I won't traverse the ground that Senator Siewert traversed, except that I, too, will not venture into the detailed science of the matter, because it is extraordinarily complex. I think this issue, firstly, highlighted the severe impact of mitochondrial disease on those who suffer from this genetic disorder. It's truly a debilitating and very confronting genetic disease, as many of the genetic diseases are. I think possibly the difference here is that there is a potential path forward. It is only, at this stage, a potential path forward. It is somewhat prospective. There has been a single child born elsewhere in the world in a very unregulated arena.<span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>There is a regime in place in the United Kingdom to allow for a more regulated approach. However, that is yet to see any results in terms of live children born without mitochondrial disease as a result, so it is a very prospective space. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the important thing to say, particularly to sufferers of mitochondrial disease, is that we still have a journey to take on this issue. It is a technique that does involve some ethical issues that need to be discussed more broadly in the Australian community rather than just a single Senate inquiry. It is something where there are multiple potential techniques, and I'm sure that, as we progress down this path to consider these issues, probably new techniques will arrive and new approaches will be developed. I think one of the most remarkable things in this space is that the opportunities to treat these rare genetic disorders are opening before us. As they open before us, we—as a parliament, and more so as a community—have to tackle some of those serious ethical issues that are involved.</span>

She did an outstanding job. I thank all colleagues who participated in the report, including Senator Pratt, who has just joined us. I think we worked extremely hard to make sure that we were all able to support the final recommendations and take this potential approach to what is a truly debilitating genetic disease forward to the Australian community.</span>

As my colleagues have highlighted, this committee report has navigated some complex moral issues associated with our reproductive technology laws, some of which were canvassed in very deep debates and important debates in this place when things like human cloning were prohibited. We now know that, actually, it's time to take a new look at these laws and see if they need to be amended to see if the disease burden suffered by Australians can be ameliorated by further research and changes in clinical practice whereby genes and mitochondrial material can be substituted in order for people to be able to remove these diseases from the lives of their offspring. These are important moral questions that deserve the Senate's attention, and I commend the report to the Senate. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="121628" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McALLISTER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:53</span>):  I present the report of the Finance and Public Administration References Committee, <span style="font-style:italic;">Digital delivery of government services</span>, together with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee. I move:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 13 June, the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Transformation announced that the government's ambition is that, by 2025, Australia will be one of the top three digital governments in the world. That would be a tremendous outcome. However, throughout the committee, it's become very clear that the soaring rhetoric, pioneered by Prime Minister Turnbull during his period as communications minister, has not been able to be translated in any meaningful way into government practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, we see the Digital Transformation Agency, the organisation within government charged with delivering this vision, marginalised in terms of its role within government, we see it beset by uncertainty in terms of its actual mission and purpose, and, most importantly, I think, we see a complete lack of government leadership or clarity around the agenda for digital transformation. This is actually a great shame, because digital represents a huge opportunity to transform the way that we deliver government services and to transform the way that we perform the broader business of government. Narrow, technocratic, penny-pinching and visionless approaches to digital transformation do not serve our democracy or our community well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has made recommendations in three broad areas. We argue for a cohesive structure for developing digital policy and reporting on progress against government. We think that there need to be clear measures of performance across departments and agencies, and public reporting on those measures. We think that in developing those measures we should prioritise user experience, not just pennies saved, because the robodebt experience teaches us that you might be able to save money, but if you make many, many thousands of Australians miserable in the process and you frighten them, then that is not a good project. That is not success, and it should not be defined as such. And we believe that there ought to be an annual ministerial statement on digital transformation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also made a series of recommendations about the use of contractors. Fascinatingly, we heard evidence from a number of government agencies which described the savings that were available to them, the improvements in performance and the increase in public value that came about when they dispensed with contractors and took the digital functions in-house. Digital is not an add-on; something that can be bought from outside government. Unless we have a core capability within government and are able to purchase digital services as informed purchasers, we will continue to see project after project fail as a consequence of the failure and lack of capability within the Australian Public Service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That leads to the third bundle of recommendations. It's not enough to say that we're not going to use contractors or not use as many of them as we do at the moment. We actually need to develop public sector digital capability. This is not something that can be put off to one side, as I said earlier. This is something that is now core business for the Australian Public Service. The Australian Public Service Commission should develop a whole-of-government career stream for ICT professionals and project managers. They actually need to tell people how they are going in lifting the number of digital apprentices in the Public Service. And, more broadly, we need the SES, the Senior Executive Service, to engage with these questions because, too often, the people who are actually making the decisions—those who are sitting in the box seat when it comes to policy choices, or technology choices or program approaches—are not themselves familiar with the tools that are available to them in the new digital world. And that gap between the skills and knowledge of more junior members of the Public Service and their bosses is a big missed opportunity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will leave my remarks there, but I do, in closing, wish to thank my fellow committee members. This is a dry subject, and a little arcane, and fellow committee members from all parts of the chamber were most cooperative in making arrangements to hear evidence. I think it's important, and I appreciated the committee's willingness to participate. I wish to thank the witnesses whose gave their time, and I also thank the committee secretariat, who prepared the report so competently. I seek leave to continue my remarks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Leave granted.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to this bill, the committee sought further information from the minister as to whether certain penalties in the bill may be 'criminal' for the purposes of international human rights law and, if so, whether the provisions were compatible with criminal process guarantees. Following correspondence with the relevant minister, the committee considered that the civil penalty provisions may be considered 'criminal' for the purposes of human rights law. However, the further information usefully provided by the assistant minister allowed the committee to nevertheless conclude that the penalties may be compatible with criminal process rights such as the right to be presumed innocent. The committee's analysis highlights how, in the context of civil penalties, if a penalty meets the test of being 'criminal' under international human rights law this does not convert the relevant conduct into a criminal offence or mean that the civil penalty is illegitimate. Instead, it means the civil penalties must be compatible with criminal process rights, and the assistant minister's detailed and helpful response outlined how the penalties constitute permissible limitations on criminal process rights. This response from the assistant minister and the department is accordingly to be commended. It is also a strong example of the type of information that should be included in statements of compatibility in relation to civil penalty provisions. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to supporting the successful settlement of all migrants to Australia and is already addressing many of the recommendations. The Inquiry repeatedly heard how Australia is recognised as a world leader in providing settlement services. Australia also has one of the smallest discrepancies between locally born and overseas born unemployment rates in the OECD. We are one of the most successful and cohesive societies in the world.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Settlement is a complex process, and both settlement and mainstream support services are important to enable new arrivals to achieve full economic and social participation and to adjust to Australian society. Australia’s approach to settlement is based on mutual benefits and responsibilities. The Australian community benefits as a whole both economically and socially from migration, which brings different skills, perspectives and knowledge. Migrants benefit from joining one of the world’s most stable, democratic and welcoming societies.</span>

The level of collaboration and co-operation achieved by these stakeholders contributes to Australia’s successful settlement outcomes.</span>

                        <span class="HPS-TableLeftAlignSmall">Justice reinvestment is fundamentally about diverting funding from the corrections system into community-based crime prevention and community strengthening programs. It is an approach that saves government spending on corrections and related criminal justice measures and reinvests those savings into the community to improve public safety. The Commonwealth Government cannot effectively fund justice reinvestment projects because state and territory governments are solely responsible for managing corrections systems in Australia and are largely responsible for corrections budgets, with the exception of a small percentage of funding for federal offenders.</span>

                        <span class="HPS-TableLeftAlignSmall">The elements that make up the criminal justice system, including prisons and in-prison rehabilitation services, are generally the responsibility of state and territory governments. Furthermore, the majority of offenders in the criminal justice system have committed offences under state and territory laws. As identified in the Minority report by Coalition Senators, the success of justice reinvestment therefore ultimately rests with the states and territories.</span>

                        <span class="HPS-TableLeftAlignSmall">The Commonwealth Government’s role also includes funding prevention programs to improve community safety, recognising that improvements in this area support a reduction in crime and may result in fewer people in prison. Examples of such programs include those under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, which allocates assets confiscated from criminals to crime prevention projects that will benefit the community, including security infrastructure and early intervention and diversion projects. The Commonwealth Government also provides funding for a range of activities to improve community safety for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians through the Indigenous Advancement Strategy (IAS).</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill implements the OECD hybrid mismatch rules, which are designed to strengthen the integrity of the tax system, continuing the Turnbull Government's work on combating multinational tax avoidance. It also includes an amendment to strengthen the Producer Offset and encourage filmmakers to employ Australian cast and crew, as well as measures to provide tax exemptions to support the International Cricket Council to hold the World Twenty20 in Australia, and an update to the registered list of Deductible Gift Recipients.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedules 1 and 2 to this Bill further reinforce the Government's commitment to tackling multinational tax avoidance, by implementing the OECD's hybrid mismatch rules, as first announced in the 2016-17 Budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The OECD's hybrid mismatch rules are one of 15 Actions resulting from the OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under this Government Australia continues to be a strong supporter of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, and remains at the forefront of global efforts to address multinational tax avoidance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The hybrid mismatch rules build upon previous Government actions on tax avoidance, including the introduction of stronger transfer pricing rules, the multinational anti-avoidance law and the diverted profits tax. The Government has also increased penalties for companies who fail to take reasonable care when making statements to the ATO, and expanded the ATO's capacity through the Tax Avoidance Taskforce.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These rules are designed to prevent multinational companies from exploiting differences in the tax treatment of instruments or entities between jurisdictions, which enable those companies to defer or reduce tax. The rules will also address situations where a company operates in multiple countries, each of which have differing views about whether or not the company has a taxable presence in that jurisdiction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The hybrid mismatch rules neutralise these mismatches by modifying the outcomes that arise under Australian income tax law. This includes disallowing an income tax deduction, or including an amount in a taxpayer's assessable income.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has also extended the scope of the hybrid mismatch rules to include a targeted integrity rule. This rule will apply to taxpayers who attempt to circumvent the hybrid mismatch rules by routing funds through foreign interposed entities, with the aim of gaining an Australian income tax deduction and avoiding the hybrid mismatch rules.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As a result of these rules, multinational companies will no longer gain an unfair tax advantage compared to their solely Australian-based counterparts. Furthermore, the hybrid rules will help to strengthen the integrity of the tax system both in Australia</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">One of those mechanisms, the Producer Offset, allows production companies to claim a tax rebate on qualifying Australian production expenditure for films with significant Australian content. In situations where the subject matter of the Australian film reasonably requires shooting in a foreign location, some overseas expenditure may be claimed. For example, a documentary about Gallipoli would require some filming to take place in Turkey.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The 'Gallipoli Clause' outlines what expenditure can be claimed under the Producer Offset for films undertaking principal photography overseas. This amendment clarifies that only expenditure relating to services provided for the film by Australian residents in such 'Gallipoli' cases is eligible to be claimed under the Producer Offset. It will further encourage the employment and use of Australian cast and crew at all stages of production.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The biosecurity system must deal with a broad range of risks posed by the possibility of pests and diseases entering and establishing in Australia. It is essential that we continue to maintain and improve our biosecurity legislation to enable us to manage these threats.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The volume of goods and people entering Australia is projected to almost double between now and 2025. It is essential that our biosecurity system keeps pace with the risks posed by these increased movements. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We are continually bringing about incremental and real improvements to our risk management arrangements. It is vital that we continue to invest in our biosecurity system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In this vein, the Coalition Government has delivered up to $200 million over four years to strengthen Australia's biosecurity system through the Agricultural Competitiveness White Paper, on top of an additional $100 million to fight pests and weeds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Since 2013, the Coalition has increased biosecurity investment by over 29 per cent, totaling $783.2 million this financial year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Along with the increased traffic at our borders, one of the key challenges we face in the effective management of biosecurity risk is difficulty collecting the necessary information we need about goods after they have entered the country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This can occur particularly when a good is imported, and later in time importation of that same good is suspended or prohibited based on an updated biosecurity risk assessment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This occurred in January 2017 with the suspension of uncooked prawns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill aims to address this difficulty by providing for information gathering powers that allow for faster and more accurate identification of "at risk" goods.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These powers will enable the Director of Biosecurity or the Director of Human Biosecurity to issue a general requirement for persons in possession of goods (such as uncooked prawns) that have been released from biosecurity control to provide information to the relevant Director about the goods (such as their current location). </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Having this information would then enable a 'secure' direction to be issued regarding the goods, which can prevent their further movement and will support targeted operational responses to control biosecurity risks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It also addresses Recommendation 2 of the Senate Committee report on biosecurity risks associated with imported seafood, including uncooked prawns. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">When used with existing powers in the Biosecurity Act, the new information gathering powers contribute to a more robust biosecurity system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Further, this Bill will allow for the gathering of information about goods imported into Australia that may have breached import conditions, so that the department can assess and where required manage biosecurity risk. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also enhances our ability to update alternative import conditions quickly and easily in response to changes in biosecurity risk.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">With these risks continuously changing and evolving it is essential that our legislation enables us to rapidly respond to these changes.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In 2009, the Australian Financial Centre Forum completed a report titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia as a Financial Centre. </span>The report later became known as the 'Johnson report', named after Mark Johnson who led both the forum and the Australian Financial Centre Task Force.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Johnson report observed that Australia had arguably the most sophisticated and advanced financial sector in the Asia-Pacific. The financial services sector remains the largest single contributor to GDP of any sector in the Australian economy and employs over 450,000 Australians. Australia also has the sixth-largest pool of managed funds in the world, and the largest in Asia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The report noted that our financial sector would benefit substantially from greater exports ­only 4 percent of funds in Australia in 2016 were sourced from overseas. It recommended a package of reforms to make it easier for Australian fund managers to attract overseas investors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">One of these recommendations was the establishment of an Asia Region Funds Passport. The Passport would provide a multilateral framework allowing eligible funds to be marketed across member countries, with limited additional regulatory requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The model for the Passport has been developed since 2010 through a series of policy and technical workshops attended by representatives from a number of APEC economies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Subsequently, the Australian Government, along with Japan, Korea, New Zealand and Thailand signed a Memorandum of Cooperation on the Establishment and Implementation of the Asia Region Funds Passport, which took effect on 30 June 2016. Since then, signatories have each been implementing the Memorandum into domestic law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Passport will support the development of the Asian funds management industry through improved market access and regulatory harmonisation. This will bring many benefits for our region, and for Australia in particular.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It will allow Australian managed funds to become Passport funds and sell their products in other participating economies. This will enable them to market their products to Asia's expanding middle class, and to the growing numbers of high net worth, and ultra-high net worth individuals in the region. Australian fund managers will be able to sell a single product across Asia and achieve greater economies of scale. This should also lower costs for consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Passport will also allow managed fund providers from other participating economies to become Passport funds and sell their products into Australia. This will increase competition and choice for Australian investors. It will provide cost effective opportunities to gain investment exposure to a wider range of assets, while ensuring protection for consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill introduces legislation to give effect to agreements made under the Memorandum and to prepare Australia for the Passport.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 1 establishes a new Chapter 8A in the Corporations Act, which mainly implements the common regulatory arrangements in Annex 2 of the Memorandum. Chapter 8A, among other things, sets out the process whereby Australian managed investment schemes may be registered by ASIC as passport funds. It also sets out the process whereby foreign passport funds may notify ASIC of their intention to offer interests in their respective funds to Australian investors, and the circumstances in which ASIC may reject such notifications.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The new chapter also provides for a mechanism to incorporate the Passport Rules in Annex 3 of the Memorandum into Australian law through the making of a legislative instrument. These Rules form a common set of obligations on all operators of passport funds. It imposes an obligation on passport funds and operators registered in Australia, as well as foreign passport funds and operators offering interests in Australia, to comply with these rules.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 2 makes amendments to other parts of the Corporations Act clarifying, among other things, how the obligations in those parts are to apply to foreign passport funds, as allowed under Annex 1 of the Memorandum. Key areas in which statutory obligations are made to apply to foreign passport funds in this manner include financial reporting, licensing and disclosure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Finally, the Bill also includes consequential changes to related Acts that refer to managed investment schemes.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Passport complements two other initiatives recommended by the Johnson report and supported by the Australian Government: an Investment Manager Regime and a new corporate collective investment vehicle. Parliament already passed legislation establishing the Investment Manager Regime in June 2015. This has clarified that investments by non-residents in foreign assets would generally be exempt from tax in Australia, ensuring that Australian fund managers can compete with overseas financial centres, including Hong Kong, Singapore, London and Tokyo.</span>

                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />The Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2018 is to amend the <span style="font-style:italic;">Farm Household Support Act 2014.</span></span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill proposes to extend the cumulative period of Farm Household Allowance from three years to four years for each recipient.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Farm Household Allowance is more than a social security payment — it is a package of assistance comprising income support, an independent financial assessment of the farm business, individualised case management, and an activity supplement that pays for advice and training. The safety net provided by this program ensures the government can appropriately support farmers in hardship while they take steps to improve their situation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The government has worked to achieve its vision for a profitable, competitive, resilient and sustainable agriculture sector. It is an industry that all Australians should be proud of— it is a pillar of the Australian economy, and it is the lifeblood of many rural and regional communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While the agriculture sector continues to be a strong performer, it is not immune to fluctuations, and variability is part and parcel of running a farm business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The government is committed to supporting our farming communities to generate wealth and build strength and prosperity. Like every other Australian, we want farmers to put money aside for a comfortable retirement. We want them to take time away from the farm for learning and development, and to take advantage of our substantial investment in research and innovation. We want them to be able to support their kids so they can dream big and achieve those dreams. Sometimes this means supporting farmers in financial hardship to help them build resilience for the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">But this support has to be equitable with other types of support. The government's general position is that Farm Household Allowance should be aligned with mainstream social security, unless there are good reasons for departure. The most significant departure is the two tier asset test, which has a significantly higher threshold for farm assets than other payments. This setting recognises that a farmer's biggest asset is their land, but in times of hardship that land is not capable of generating a return that sustains the family.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The book value excludes the farmer from other income support payments, yet the farmer cannot realise those assets for self-support without taking away some, or all, of the longer-term income producing capacity of the farm enterprise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A key element of the program includes an independent financial assessment of the business to sustain the family into the future. This assessment is backed up by one on one case management and an activity supplement of $3,000 per person from day one to put towards advice or training to improve their situation. Under the Agriculture White Paper we added a further $1,000 per recipient in the final year of payment. That's $8,000 over and above the fortnightly payment for a couple on payment. This extension of the payment will also give people longer to choose activities that will help them into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This supplement is not limited to agricultural extension activities — it pays for things that are going to increase the total household income. It can pay for truck and bus licences, forklift</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">tickets, welding qualifications, drone training, teacher training, web site design — whatever our farmers and their partners can reasonably think of to generate income.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">And we don't stop there. Since 2013, this government has committed more than $90 million to the Rural Financial Counselling Service program. This is not a bricks and mortar service. Staff are highly mobile and visit people on-farm or in town, as it suits them. Rural financial counsellors complement and support the work of the Farm Household Case Officers by working closely with recipients so they can make sustainable changes. Although the overwhelming majority of people remain on farm, some do make that tough decision to sell up and try something new. Farm Household Allowance provides the breathing space for these big decisions. The support of the case officer and the rural financial counsellor can make a huge difference. People can plan their next move and take some time to make that happen. They can come on and off payment as many times as suits their circumstances, truly using it as a safety net.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We know the Farm Household Allowance is well received. The government has outlaid more than $230 million that has helped over 7,900 farmers and their partners. Recipients of the support have been surveyed and almost 90 per cent of respondents reported that the program had improved their current financial circumstances, and more than 50 per cent expect to stay on farm with greater farm income and/or less debt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The extension of support for a further year will help farmers who have not had the opportunity to implement their plans for financial self-sufficiency. The government has listened to many farmers suffering due to the ongoing unfavourable climatic conditions across parts of the eastern seaboard. The additional income to small towns and rural centres will also assist regions as a whole by broadening the economic base.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">When the Farm Household Allowance program was introduced in 2014, the cumulative period of Farm Household Allowance available to an eligible farmer or their partner was set at three years, or 1,095 days.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">However, this government has seen first-hand and listened to the experiences of Australian farmers. We know that some farmers and their families have been, and continue to be, subject to pressures that extend beyond a cumulative three year period, and need more time to recover from hardship and get back on their feet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill therefore proposes extending the cumulative period of Farm Household Allowance to four years, or 1,460 days. This extension will apply to current and future recipients, as well as those who have already concluded their initial three year cumulative period of entitlement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In short, extending the Farm Household Allowance will give recipients greater opportunities to improve their circumstances, or consider an alternative future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In seeking to extend the cumulative period of Farm Household Allowance from three years to four years, this Bill further demonstrates this government's responsiveness to the needs of the farming community and the conditions faced in rural and regional Australia. The Government will continue to look for opportunities to improve the Farm Household Allowance program, including streamlining applications where it is necessary appropriate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill enacts key recommendations from the Financial System Inquiry and the ASIC Capability Review.

                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">providing ASIC with a stronger funding base through the introduction of the industry funding model.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Schedule 1 to this Bill amends the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001</span> to mandate that ASIC must consider the effects that the performance of its functions and the exercise of its powers will have on competition in the financial system.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Removing the obligation for ASIC to engage staff under the Public Service Act<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>means ASIC will be able to compete more effectively for suitable staff.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This measure fulfils the Government's commitment to implementing recommendation 24 of the ASIC Capability Review Report. This recommendation stated that the Government should remove ASIC from the Public Service Act as a matter of priority, to support more effective recruitment and retention strategies. A similar finding was also found in the context of the Financial System Inquiry.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill will continue the policy framework of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976</span>, but broaden it to extend protection to all Australia's underwater cultural heritage. The Historic Shipwrecks Act is to be repealed. The Bill clarifies present and future jurisdictional arrangements for protecting and managing aircraft and other underwater cultural heritage consistent with the 2010 <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Underwater Cultural Heritage Intergovernmental Agreement</span>. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For the first time it gives distinct recognition to discovered human remains. It also recognises the important role of the public in underwater cultural heritage. It strengthens the regulatory framework for better day to day protection of sites and associated articles. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Several key policy elements in the Bill result from public feedback given during a review of 'the Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976 and Australia's consideration of ratification of the UNESCO 2001 <span style="font-style:italic;">Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage</span>'. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill is consistent with the <span style="font-style:italic;">1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea</span> and positions us to participate in the global community's response to threats to underwater cultural heritage. Participation would give Australia an international legal basis for protecting our underwater and shared underwater cultural heritage outside 24 nautical miles from the territorial sea baseline but in the 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone, such as the recently located USS <span style="font-style:italic;">Lexington</span>, which was lost in the Battle of the Coral Sea in 1942.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Subject to consultation with the relevant coastal State, this Bill enables the protection of underwater cultural heritage significant to Australia that is located outside of Australian jurisdictional waters, such as HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">AE1 </span>in Papua New Guinea. It also regulates actions by Australians on these sites by permit. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Other policy elements, continuing from the 1976 Act, include: the capacity to give effect to the <span style="font-style:italic;">1972 Australia-Netherlands Agreement concerning Old Dutch Shipwrecks</span>; mandatory reporting of new discoveries; and retaining the delegated framework that has enabled effective collaborative administration with the States and Northern Territory since 1983. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">All shipwrecks that have been underwater for 75 years remain protected and this level of protection will now be extended to sunken aircraft and their associated articles. Shipwrecks and aircraft that have been underwater less than 75 years, and other types of underwater cultural heritage, can be protected through individual declaration based on an assessment of heritage significance. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Consistent with recommendations from the 2015 review of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act 1986</span>, this Bill enables the regulation of Australian and foreign persons in regards to importing and exporting protected underwater cultural heritage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In line with the Government's commitment to minimising regulatory burden, this Bill simplifies the sale or transfer of protected articles by introducing a transferable permit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also aligns with Government compliance policy, strengthening and broadening the range of investigation and enforcement powers, and includes a graduated approach to compliance and enforcement to better protect underwater cultural sites. </span>

There is no greater responsibility for any national government in Australia or for the parliament than the safety and security of our people. Today threats come in many forms, and not just over our physical borders. Espionage is an ancient profession, one that also comes in many forms. These two bills implement a key pillar of the Australian government's reforms of our intelligence and security landscape. These, along with other reforms set to be introduced in this place in relation to foreign donations and our electoral system, are the most significant changes to our national security environment in decades.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a debate or a time to make political points. It is an opportunity for senators in this place to make a meaningful contribution to the national security of our nation—again, to deal with old and new forms of espionage and foreign interference that threaten our nation. But it is also an opportunity for all of us, as legislators, to show real leadership and to demonstrate to Australians that we can come together on important issues such as this, which is exactly what we have done. The safety and security of Australian people are important. The resilience of our infrastructure and communications systems is important. The stability of our democracy is important. And these three principles are grounded in both of these bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd personally like to thank the opposition for supporting these bills and also for working with us in the committee on the foreign donations legislation. Again, the debates on these bills and also on the foreign donations bill demonstrate to me very clearly that we can and we do come together on important issues for this nation. For me it's just a shame that sometimes the rest of Australia doesn't get to see what we see here every day—that we do work together in the national interest on so many issues that very rarely ever get exposure outside this building. This parliament is always at its best when we're discussing challenging issues in a robust way, within committees, finding consensus and delivering a report with recommendations that governments can implement and that oppositions can support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These bills themselves are in response to an increasing threat of foreign interference and espionage in our nation. Peter Vickery, the Director-General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, told the parliament earlier this year:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Cold War obviously was a busy time for a number of parts of the world but that was a different era, that was a different time. It didn't exhibit the same sort of globalisation characteristics that we currently have and the way in which foreign espionage and espionage activities can be conducted remotely—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">worlds away, nations away from our own country—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the current climate, we're facing a raft of different countries that are seeking to conduct espionage and foreign interference—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">right here in Australia—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It's much more blurred in a sense, there's much more state actors out there than there was during that time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that if unchecked these threats can erode our sovereignty and diminish public confidence in the integrity of our political system and also in our government institutions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2018 will introduce new foreign interference offences targeting covert, deceptive or threatening actions on behalf of foreign actors to influence Australia's democratic processes or to harm Australia itself. Again, these are not theoretical issues. These are real and present threats that are happening right here in Australia today. The bill also seeks to reform Commonwealth secrecy offences, ensuring that they appropriately criminalise unauthorised disclosure of harmful information while also protecting freedoms of speech. They also introduce comprehensive new sabotage offences that effectively protect critical infrastructure in the modern environment. This is not only a risk of espionage, in terms of finding out the information and how to actually access and bring down our critical infrastructure, but also a significant national security and defence threat.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Modernisation and reform offences against the government are also included in this bill. To better protect Australia's defence and also democracy, it includes 'treason'. The bill also introduces a new 'theft of trade secret' offence to protect Australia from economic espionage by foreign government principles. Again, as chair of two defence committees in this parliament, I know just how real this threat is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill 2017 will establish a scheme to provide visibility to the public, but also to decision-makers in government, about foreign influence over Australian government and political processes. This is something that the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters looked at. Again, it is very clear that it does exist and the threat in Australia is growing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The scheme will require registration for activities undertaken on behalf of foreign principals to influence Australia's government and also its political processes—again, foreigners seeking to influence and interfere in matters that should ever only be matters for Australians to determine. This means that activities undertaken on behalf of foreign principals will be publicly available to all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, and quite rightly, these bills have been the subject of much consideration and debate in the Australian community. The Commonwealth government has heard and listened to these concerns. The committee report delivered by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security has taken account of these concerns, and has come up with a very sensible suite of recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to the committee's report, this is what the government have agreed to do. They've agreed to narrow the scope of secrecy and espionage offences to strengthen the defence for journalists and provide additional defences that apply to whistleblowers and other legitimate conduct in our activity by Australians. It will clarify key terms including 'prejudice to Australian national security' and 'foreign political organisation'. It will also require a review of the operation and effectiveness of the new offences created by the bill after three years of the offences commencing operation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments are based on recommendations made by the PJCIS, and are also in response to community concerns. As chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, as I've said, I know the threats to our nation are real in many, many ways: through the targeting of our infrastructure, our corporate sector, our government institutions and also the pillars and institutions that support democracy here in Australia. No senators in this place should ever, ever underestimate these threats.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In all seriousness, I echo the sentiments of the Attorney-General when he spoke on these bills in the other place. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That threat is from new forms of espionage practised in the modern age. These bills are detailed and legally complex, but the central principle of their necessity can be described simply by saying that we cannot protect Australia against modern espionage in the age of <span style="font-style:italic;">Skyfall</span> with counterintelligence laws drafted for the era of <span style="font-style:italic;">Goldfinger</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On that very sage note, I commend these bills to the Senate and I encourage all in this place to support this important legislation. Again, I thank and commend those opposite for their bipartisan approach to national security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="39801" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CHISHOLM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:20</span>):  I want to use this opportunity to pay tribute to Queensland Labor legend Terry Mackenroth, who, sadly, passed away recently. Terry, for those who knew him and for many people in Queensland, was known as 'The Fox' because of his wily political skills that he honed over a long period of time. Terry had a remarkable career in state parliament. Unfortunately, the first 12 years of that was spent in opposition when the Labor Party was in opposition for 32 years at the state level. Terry honed his political skills during that time—and it was really a rough-and-tumble Queensland parliament at that time. He was then able to use those skills effectively when we got out of opposition. He was an integral part of the Goss government coming to power in 1989. Terry's history as a minister and as a key part of that Goss government is a remarkable list of achievements, including a significant stint as police minister and doing so much to modernise Queensland, working with Wayne Goss who was such a tremendous Labor Premier.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Terry had a significant career in government. It is great that he was able to do that after spending so much time in opposition. Terry was also a significant part of the Peter Beattie government and, in particular, of Peter's 2001 election win, which, from a Labor point of view, was the most significant win we have ever had in Queensland. Terry takes particular credit for a strategy that led to that 2001 landslide. When the conservative forces were so split, it really did signal that there was only one option, and that was 'vote 1 for Labor'. During the term of the Peter Beattie government, Terry rose to become Deputy Premier and Treasurer. He had a significant list of achievements as Treasurer. A key part of that, and the key legacy of Terry running through opposition to government and rising to Deputy Premier—and indeed in life after politics—was that Terry never forgot where he came from. He grew up in the electorate he represented, and he continued to live in that community until he passed away. Labor people understand and admire those people who grow up in their electorates and then get the opportunity to represent those electorates; it means a little bit more to them that they are able to do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think there were some real constants in Terry's life, particularly when it came to politics, that he really stuck to—whether internal or external. Terry was tough but fair, he never forgot where he came from, and he was a foundation rock that the success of the Goss and Beattie governments was built on. Terry's many achievements are on the public record. But I just want to talk a bit about how I got to know Terry when he left politics, because I think this is also important to show the type of person he was. For me, Terry was the model of an ex-politician in that he never sought to interfere, he never sought to cause trouble, but he was always happy to offer his point of view. He'd say, 'I don't want to give you any advice, but I'm always happy to give you my view and it is up to you whether you take it.' As someone who was involved in campaigning at the time, I really appreciated that Terry never sought to interfere and never said he knew best. He would always offer a view, and then it was up to you whether you took it. When we lost government in 2012, we had so little experience in opposition that Terry was a great help to us given his experience. He became very close with Annastacia Palaszczuk as Premier and continued to be a close confidant of hers until his sad passing. And he was a great help to us when we won the election in 2015. When most people weren't giving us a chance, Terry was happy to stick to his Labor Party values and ensure he could give the best advice to Annastacia and her team.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More recently, I spent time with Terry at Broncos games. We were both season ticket holders and Terry sat a few rows in front of me. I always took the opportunity to have a chat with him about politics. He was always interested in what was going on and keeping a close eye on things. He also played an integral role with Annastacia in her last election campaign. I'm very sad at Terry's sudden passing. Our thoughts are with Mary and his extended family. I pay tribute to Terry. Vale, Terry Mackenroth.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RHIANNON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:25</span>):  On 9 May, Malaysians delivered an astounding victory to democracy and voted out the government under the scandal-plagued former Prime Minister Najib Razak. The new government, under the leadership of 92-year-old Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, has promised to restore democracy to the country. Unlawful financial activities and abusive democratic practices had become the hallmark of the previous government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A series of corruption scandals have wracked Malaysia for many years. One scandal involved suspicious asset purchases and fund deposits funnelled through Australia, and they may be linked to large-scale corruption in Malaysia that reaches to the highest level of authority in that country. This scandal involves 1Malaysia Development Berhad, known as 1MDB, a government-owned sovereign wealth fund. In 2009, shortly after Mr Razak became the Prime Minister of Malaysia, he became the chair of the 1MDB advisory board. He was also the country's finance minister. The fund was intended to support projects of national significance to boost Malaysia's economic growth and attract international investment. The fund performed disastrously. From 2009 onwards, many of 1MDB's investments failed, and, by the end of 2014, the fund had more than $12 billion in debt and was struggling to repay its loans.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been informed that, in the period from 2009 to at least 2014, multiple individuals, including public officials and their associates, conspired to fraudulently divert billions of dollars from 1MDB through various means. According to the US Department of Justice, which has been investigating, more than US$4.5 billion was diverted from 1MDB and laundered through a web of shell companies and bank accounts located in the United States and other countries, one of them being Australia. Several major financial institutions were caught up in the scandal, with reports of big kickbacks. These institutions include AmBank—24 per cent owned by ANZ—Goldman Sachs, Swiss UBS and BSI SA.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the US Department of Justice investigation, the funds diverted from 1MDB were used for the personal benefit of the co-conspirators and their relatives and associates, including to purchase luxury real estate in the United States, pay gambling expenses at Las Vegas casinos, acquire more than US$200 million in artwork, invest in a major New York real estate development project and fund the production of major Hollywood films. Last year the US Department of Justice seized $1.3 billion in assets held by close associates and relatives of the Prime Minister, allegedly siphoned from 1MDB. Singapore has jailed three bankers for money laundering connected to the fund. Australia has yet to begin its own probe on alleged money laundering transactions and other links with the corruption scandal in Malaysia. Najib's government has left a huge debt burden for Malaysia. Its public debt has exceeded A$334 billion. Much of this has been inflated by borrowing to bail out the state investment company 1MDB, which is at the centre of a multibillion-dollar scandal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Members of the Malaysian community committed to restoring democracy in their country have asked me questions that the Turnbull government must answer. They've asked why the government isn't freezing assets acquired in Australia that have been linked to corrupt activities in Malaysia with the aim of returning them to Malaysia, much like what is being carried out by the US Department of Justice's Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative. They've also asked why the Turnbull government isn't instructing AUSTRAC and the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry to investigate money laundering activities and financial transactions in Australia that are connected to corruption in Malaysia. The comment has certainly been made: if Australia doesn't act, it starts to reflect on Australia and not just on the former Prime Minister and his associates in Malaysia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="207825" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKENZIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Rural Health, Minister for Sport, Minister for Regional Communications and Deputy Leader of The Nationals</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:29</span>):  It's a great privilege to stand here this evening in the Senate and honour a great man, but it does fill me with great sadness to be doing it so soon. While Dexter lived just 66 years, he made those 66 years count.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Hon. Dexter Melvyn Davies was a man who lived life to the fullest and a man who gave so much to his family, to the National Party, to his friends, to his colleagues and to regional Australia. He is survived by his beloved wife, Leonie; his daughters, Mia and Emma; and grandchildren, Harry and Ella.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dexter was born in Kellerberrin, a small farming town in the WA Wheatbelt in 1951. Funnily enough, Kellerberrin is where the Country Party was formed over 100 years ago. Dexter's heart remained in the Central Wheatbelt and in regional Australia. Indeed, his love for regional Australia led him through much of his life and his work. He demonstrated this commitment to the regions every day as a farmer, and later in his political and public service career.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Apart from his family and his sport—Dexter was a life member of his cricket club and served as his football club's president—his other great passion included making a difference to the regions. In 1980, Dexter joined the Nationals in WA, and this decision defined much of his future contribution to public life and the party. He served as the Nationals party president in WA for 10 years, as well as the federal vice-president for 12 years, including most recently from 2015 until he left. Dexter was the president of Nationals WA up until 1998, when he was then elected into the WA parliament in the Legislative Council, appropriately as the MLC for Agricultural Regions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of his personal qualities was his ability to connect with people from all walks of life, no matter their title, their age or their background. People felt like they could relate to Dexter, and felt he was an open ear. That's because he actually was, and I enjoyed many, many a late-night conversation following federal council or conference over the years. This is one of the reasons he was spoken of so fondly by those that met him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was the ultimate team man in politics, sport, family and life. The Nationals will miss Dexter's passion and particularly his wit and his generosity. He'll be remembered as a man of great honour and dedication, and a true champion of our small, but mighty, party. Dexter was one of the greats of our party, and it is upon his shoulders that the success of our party stands. I take inspiration from Dexter's life, his commitment and his words, and I would like to briefly share with the chamber some words he made in his inaugural speech, when he asked us all:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">How long is it since each of us has devised a new plan about what we can do to help regional communities to thrive and prosper? How long is it since we worked hard to ensure that government resources and regulations are used to help people, not hinder them; that our children can get the best education in the local town; that there will be a choice of local jobs; and that there will be a doctor and local hospital; in other words, to create opportunity, not limit it, in this world of change?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dexter, on behalf of the federal National Party, and as Deputy Leader, we want to lead the change you talked about. We pay respects to our dear friend and confidante and to a passionate regional Australian, Dexter Davies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to briefly mention tonight the passing of Peter Thompson. Last week, Australia lost a legend, and arguably one of the world's best golfers. He was the first Australian to win the British Open. He went on to win the open five times, and had top-10 finishes. He was the only player in the 20th century to win the open championship for three straight years. He was three-time captain of the Presidents Cup International, and he captained the international side to its only win over the United States at the Presidents Cup at Royal Melbourne.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many may know that before he was a professional golfer Peter was a promising cricketer, and he even scored an unbeaten 150 for the Carlton club as a 15-year-old. But it was golf that he was passionate about. He designed a lot of golf courses, over 100, post retirement from professional golf. He was also made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his services to golf and entered the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1988.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I love the sentence in which he best captured his life:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I've had a very joyful life, playing a game that I loved to play for the sheer pleasure of it. I don't think I did a real day's work in the whole of my life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That sounds like a pretty good life to me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was highly regarded as the gentleman of the game. He passed away surrounded by his family. He was 88, and our thoughts, and those of the government, are with his family and friends, particularly with his wife, Mary; son, Andrew; daughters Deidre, Peta-Ann and Fiona and their spouses; and 11 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="F49" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAROL BROWN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  I rise to talk about the matter of penalty rates. This matter represents just how consistently the government continue to support the top end of town over the needs of all Australians. Earlier this week, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten, introduced legislation to protect penalty rates and to protect the wages of working Australians, placing Labor values front and centre and standing in stark contrast with the out-of-touch Prime Minister. I'm proud to serve on a team that values retail workers and food and accommodation workers and wants to see the extra pay they receive for working weekends and holidays protected. I'm proud to serve on a team that's fighting for the wages of over 40,000 Tasmanians. The wages of those who rely upon penalty rates are not some luxury. Those wages are not the $7,000 that this out-of-touch government have voted to give themselves in tax cuts; they are a necessity and they can be as much as $77 a week for many. Unfortunately, the current government are so out of touch that they don't see the need to support Labor's bill. The government are more focused on an $80 billion handout to banks and big businesses than they are on the wages of Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Penalty rates are scheduled to be cut again from 1 July, which is on Sunday. That means that, as soon as Sunday, workers who have relied upon the additional income they receive from working weekends will no longer be able to count on that income to pay their bills. Given that over 700,000 workers across the country are slated to have their pay cut and, given that inequality, part-time work and insecure work are on the rise, now is the time for the government to stop looking after their mates in the big banks and multinationals and start looking out for workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A Senate inquiry last year told us that penalty rates are not a luxury. It told us that many seek to work the unsociable hours required to obtain those rates because the rate of pay is higher during those hours and, to quote the Fair Work Commission, 'Many of these employees earn just enough to cover weekly living expenses.' In fact, more than 9,100 people in Denison working in retail, food and accommodation rely upon penalty rates to help them meet the cost of goods and services. It involves more than 8,500 workers in Bass, 7,200 in Lyons, 7,800 in Franklin and 7,200 workers in the electorate of Braddon. Mr Brett Whiteley, who once claimed to represent the Braddon electorate, stood by as the government failed time and time again to vote to protect penalty rates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to serve a party that represents workers and has an appreciation for the importance of penalty rates. I'm proud to back the candidate, Justine Keay, who will fight for the people of Braddon and will fight for the 7,200 workers relying on penalty rates in the electorate of Braddon. It's Labor that ensures we value all Australians and work to foster a more equal society for everyone. The government could join with Labor and legislate to protect penalty rates. The government could show that they're committed to workers and understand the value that penalty rates bring to between three per cent and four per cent of our workforce. They could show that they're on the side of the 75 economists and academics who, earlier this year, wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">While it is doubtful that lower penalty rates will result in any measurable increase in total employment in the retail and hospitality industries there is no doubt that this decision will reduce incomes for some of the most insecure and poorly paid workers in the economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's just hard to understand at a time when inequality is one of the major threats that we face as a nation. When reducing penalty rates even hurts the economic growth the government claim to stand for, why is it that the government won't take the action needed to drive growth and stand up for workers? Why do the government continue to prioritise the top end of town? And why won't they join Labor in legislating to protect penalty rates? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="275424" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STORER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:39</span>):  As the CEO of the Energy Efficiency Council has said today, 'There were two pieces of bad news for Australia last night; one was our result in the World Cup, but it was Australia's poor performance on energy efficiency that kept me awake.' It is greatly disappointing to report last night's release of the 2018 International Energy Efficiency Scorecard: Australia ranks worst for energy efficiency in the developed world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Poor standards in energy efficiency have considerable consequences for those most vulnerable in our society. In particular, thousands of South Australian renters on low incomes, for example, are bearing the full brunt of skyrocketing power bills, which are unnecessarily exacerbated by energy inefficient properties that plague low income rental properties. Worryingly, many renters in South Australia are scared to turn on their heating and cooling when they need it most out of fear that the costs involved would make their everyday lives unbearable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I was surprised to learn that current tax law actually acts as a disincentive for landlords to improve the energy efficiency of their rental properties. More strongly, current tax law actually encourages landlords to retain energy inefficient properties. We need to remove these disincentives on the grounds of fairness, sustainability and prosperity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Sustainable Built Environment Council, ACOSS, and Better Renting, among others, have made clear recommendations for how we might improve energy efficiency in residential rental properties. Those recommendations have broad and strong support from the Australian people. A report by the Property Council of Australia, the Energy Efficiency Council and ACOSS that was released in April this year highlighted that 'a remarkable 88 per cent of voters want governments to invest in energy efficiency, making it the most popular policy option.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, there are many strong reasons to support a transition to more energy efficient homes, as is strongly evident in the peer-reviewed literature. One reason is that there is strong evidence that those living in energy-inefficient homes are more likely to experience poor health outcomes. Housing is an important determinant of health, and it is clear in the literature that improving energy efficiency of housing can have dramatic health improvements for those most vulnerable—with 6.5 per cent of deaths in Australia being attributable to cold weather, as opposed to only 3.9 per cent in Sweden, a much colder country!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Quality of housing is certainly a contributing factor, but the quality of life and opportunities available for renters is where improving energy efficiency can make a big impact. Nobody should have to the make the choice between living healthily and putting food on the table. As noted by Bird and Hernandez in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Energy Policy Journal</span> in 2012:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… low income renters often spend the highest percentages of their income on energy and heating costs, yet they receive the lowest amounts of energy per dollar spent because ... efficiency measures in their rental units are often at the lowest levels of efficiency.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Low-income renters are especially vulnerable and are often worse hit by the 'split-incentives' problem, whereby landlords do not see benefits from investing in the energy efficiency of their rental properties but their tenants do—but it does not have to be that way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2017 ACIL Allen <span style="font-style:italic;">Multiple impacts of house</span><span style="font-style:italic;">hold energy efficiency</span> report outlines the full gamut of reasons to strongly support energy efficiency policies. Some key reasons they outlined include: reduced household energy consumption and bill savings; reduced damp and mould; reduced financial stress; reduced mortality; reduced family tensions and social cohesion; reduced public health spending; reduced CO2 emissions; fewer days off work or school; improved thermal comfort; improved physical health; improved diet; improved mental wellbeing; increased property values; increased economic output; and increased employment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why we need to change the tax treatment of energy efficiency upgrades. It is why I have proposed a private senator's bill in order to remove current disincentives that get in the way of critical energy efficiency upgrades to rental properties. The policy change I am advocating for is a win for people who rent. It is a win for landlords. It is a win for business. It is a win for our environment. My time now is limited; however, I look forward to continuing my remarks in due course.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:44</span>):  Tasmanians breathe some of the worlds cleanest air and enjoy rainwater of extraordinary purity. We have pristine coastal seas and rich, fertile soils that enable us to produce the finest foods and products. Alongside our award-winning wine, gin, beef, dairy and stone fruits industries proudly stands our honey industry, particularly that form of honey known as manuka. That's right, I say ma-noo-ka, not ma-na-ka, as those of us familiar with Canberra would say. Apart from the delicious taste, manuka honey contains antibiotic resistant bacteria and other microbes that provide wound-healing and anti-inflammatory benefits. This quality has added to its success and unique sales appeal. High-value manuka honey is currently selling from between $120 and $150 per kilogram, with the global industry estimated to be worth billions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my home state of Tasmania, the manuka brand is an important component of our island's export market and a consistent contributor to our global reputation for fine food and produce. However, the manuka product and the future of the industry in Tasmania and, indeed, across Australia is currently under a real threat due to trademark action that has been initiated in the United Kingdom. This action seeks to prevent Australian producers from using the word 'manuka' to market and brand their product. This action has been brought by our cousins across the ditch and, if the action of the New Zealand honey growers should be successful, the consequences for our domestic honey industry would be dire.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, this issue was brought to my attention by local Tasmanian producers Lindsay and Yeonsoon Bourke of Australian Honey Products. Since that initial approach, I—along with my Tasmanian Liberal Senate colleagues Senators Abetz, Colbeck and Duniam, as well as Senator the Hon. James McGrath—have been collaborating with honey producers across the nation, as well as with the federal Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, the Hon. David Littleproud, to help support the defence of this unique and important domestic agricultural industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the trademark action in the UK is yet to be finalised, the newly formed Australian Manuka Honey Association, led by Paul Callander, has been working tirelessly to raise the significant funds required to adequately resource the fight for Australian manuka honey producers to protect their right to continue to brand their product produced using a native Australian plant as manuka honey.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To appreciate the significance of the trademark action, it is important to understand the historical context of manuka honey production in our country. Manuka honey is produced from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Leptospermum scoparium</span> species of plants. Australia is home to over 80 species of <span style="font-style:italic;">Leptospermum scoparium</span>, while New Zealand only has one species, and even that is believed to have originated in Tasmania. Prior to the introduction of the European honey bee, manuka honey did not exist. The honey bee was first introduced to the Australian mainland in 1822, and to Tasmania in 1831. However, it took a further eight years, in 1839, for the European honey bees to make their way to the land of the long white cloud.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has a long and proud association with the word 'manuka', stemming back to early European settlement when the word 'manuka' was used for naming places, property and, of course, the plant. It is, indeed, an Australian term, and not a New Zealand one. I was also pleased to learn that the Australian Honey Bee Industry Council recently committed $50,000 towards fighting the New Zealand trademark action. However, more money is still required, and the Manuka Honey Association is relentlessly working to raise funds. I wish them continued success in their endeavours.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I and my colleagues work to identify possible means of assistance, I was delighted by the announcement from the agriculture minister that the federal coalition government has granted $165,000 to the Australian Manuka Honey Association to assist them in marketing manuka products, educating the public and building the manuka brand across Australia. Not only will this help build awareness of the manuka brand, to the good of the industry, but it will also be particularly important in highlighting to multiple stakeholder groups just how vital this multimillion-dollar industry is, especially to regional and rural Australia like in my home state of Tasmania, and help generate additional support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The mere suggestion that a single nation should be able to use trademark law to claim a name in common use for a product long produced in other countries across the globe is, quite frankly, simply wrong. Common sense and some good old-fashioned fair play need to prevail in this matter. Tonight I want to reassure Australian manuka honey growers, particularly those in my home state of Tasmania, that I remain committed to continuing to work with both industry and government stakeholders to ensure that manuka honey producers remain able to export their first-class products under the label 'manuka honey' for many years to come.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="155410" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RICE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:50</span>):  I'm honoured tonight to be sharing some of the story of Chris—a person whose pathway in life has not been easy. Looking back, Chris can now say that he knew he was gay when he was around 10 years old. Some years later, he came out to a church leader who wanted him to be cured. Chris began sessions with a counsellor aimed at changing his sexuality. He was only 16 when his conversion therapy began. The reason I'm telling Chris's story is because it's not unique. Gay conversion therapy is not as rare as you might think. Chris's story highlights how destructive, how damaging, this so-called therapy is, and why we need to stamp out this harmful practice once and for all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At 17, Chris's church introduced him to the leader of a program designed to turn him straight, and eventually, believing he needed to be cured of his sexuality, he was desperate enough to try it. The program was run by Living Waters Australia, one of the longest-running gay conversion therapy programs in Australia. Chris recalls that, every week, members spoke about their sins and they learned about the spiritual and experiential reasons that had led them to turn gay. He speaks of being so ashamed and guilt-ridden that he remained completely celibate for years. In his words: 'It was a pretty lonely way to live, really—but that's what I felt I had to do.' He believed there were demons inside him and was desperate to be healed. Can you imagine the fear he must have felt? He prayed to God, asking him to either heal him or kill him. Heal him or kill him. As you can imagine, the trauma associated with attempted gay conversion still affects Chris today. How could it not?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thanks to research by Dr Timothy Jones and others at La Trobe University, we know that conversion therapy, far from going away, is actually expanding in Australia; it's just going further underground. Organisations are changing their names and their public profiles, but they're still doing the same insidious and harmful work. Dr Jones says: 'There is no evidence that gay conversion therapy works. We really want religious groups to recognise that these practices, that they're doing in a well-meaning way, are actually harming their own people.' It's devastating to think that, around Australia, young people are trying to 'pray the gay away', and feel immense shame about who they are.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Chris's story breaks my heart. To think that his church, which is supposed to stand for love and acceptance, could put him through such harmful processes just sickens me. I'm so glad that he has come through the trauma that he endured from conversion therapy. He is now flourishing and is comfortable with who he is. But what about the other kids who are not so lucky, who don't come out the other side? We know that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer young people suffer much worse mental health than heterosexual young people. The fact that gay conversion therapy is still happening in 2018 is absolutely unacceptable. LGBTIQ people should be receiving support, education and understanding, not being funnelled into vicious programs that use shame and fear as 'conversion' tactics in the name of religion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to eradicate all reparative sexual orientation and gender identity conversion therapies. The Greens are calling on the federal government to take action now. This is a national issue, and people are being hurt. Prime Minister Turnbull and Minister for Health Greg Hunt urgently need to lead the conversation, to work with the states and territories, to engage with experts, to hear survivors and to stamp out this harmful practice once and for all. I thank Chris for sharing his story with me and allowing me to share it here in this place. I hope that it resonates with members in this chamber so that we can work together to right this wrong. These harmful practices must be stamped out, not pushed further underground. No-one else should have to feel the fear and shame that Chris felt for so many years.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="DT6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BARTLETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:55</span>):  I'd like to speak tonight about per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances, most commonly known as PFAS. They are used in a variety of ways but most commonly, particularly historically, in firefighting foam. The consequences of the way PFAS has got into land and water in so many sites around Australia have been devastating for a number of communities, particularly for a number of communities in my own state of Queensland. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are currently a range of inquiries or investigations in sites in Queensland about the historical use of PFAS, including Army Aviation Centre Oakey, west of Toowoomba, which is perhaps the most widely known; various Department of Defence sites; Airservices Australia sites; Queensland Fire and Emergency Services sites; Svensson Heights at Bundaberg; sites around Ayr; Queensland port sites; Brisbane Airport; and a Narangba facility. When I speak of Department of Defence sites, I might mention that I put a question on notice to the minister not long after I came back into this place, checking if that included the site at Shoalwater Bay, where military exercises frequently happened. The response came back that, no, it doesn't. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke with somebody in Yeppoon not long ago, near that area. It's anecdotal but, nonetheless, they were someone who was in a position to know. I asked them if it was likely to have been used there at all. They said, 'No, probably not, but National Parks used it all the time for fires in Byfield National Park, which surrounds the area.' This makes the point that it isn't just a Department of Defence issue. PFAS has been widely used by a number of organisations, but it is very transferrable underground, particularly into waterways. We're looking at Brisbane Airport. As most people here would know, as they use airports a lot, Brisbane Airport is on the shores of Moreton Bay and bounded by the Brisbane River and Kedron Brook. So any leakage into waterways can have significant impact. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been some community consultations, it is true, but there has been no resolution. If we're talking about the community of Oakey, for example, it's now been three years. There are plenty of people, including scientists, who will say, 'We're unsure about the health impacts.' Of course, scientists need to be cautious before they can be definitive. But one thing you can be definitive about is that it is already having a very direct impact on the livelihoods, the economies, the health and the futures of a whole range of individuals in Oakey and elsewhere. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that this chemical, PFAS, has been banned in Queensland since July 2016 and is now being phased out. In early 2017 a voluntary industry survey was undertaken to determine the status of foam stocks throughout the state. Even though it was banned in 2016, we've seen recent media reports that RAAF Base Amberley in Ipswich, just west of Brisbane, has been dumping sludge full of PFAS just 30 metres from a waterway—Warrill Creek—flowing to the Bremer River near Amberley. Now we have Queensland Health warning locals not to eat fish caught in that area because they've been poisoned by PFAS-contaminated sludge dumped, pretty much, right on the banks of those waterways by the Department of Defence or people employed or contracted by the Department of Defence. Defence didn't inform the community. They informed Queensland Health, but it took a long time for the wider community to be told about this. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An article in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Brisbane Times</span> by Toby Crockford on 15 June detailed this. Earlier this month, articles in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span>, by Rory Callinan and Michael McKenna, talked about this contaminated mud being shifted off the Amberley air base during the period from late 2016 to mid-2017. This is after it had been banned and after it was well known that this was a potentially significant problem. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have farmers being told—for example, near Esso's Longford gas plant and RAAF Base East Sale in Gippsland, Victoria—not to eat meat from their own properties. But they can still sell it. Try selling that. Try selling product where you tell people, 'I'm not allowed to eat it this. But here, buy it yourself.' Try selling your land. The people around Oakey and elsewhere have been suffering for three years. There's now a class action that's had to be taken to try to get a resolution. Have all your investigations, but the people are suffering now and they have been suffering for years. You cannot say that there is any doubt that they are suffering massive economic harm as a direct result of this. They should be able to be compensated, rather than continue to be drawn through more and more uncertainty and more and more inquiries.</span>
