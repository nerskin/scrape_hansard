This delivers on a commitment the coalition made at the 2013 federal election. It also follows my appointment as Australia's first federal minister for both trade and investment. This highlights the priority the Abbott government has placed on attracting inbound capital to support our nation's continued economic growth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the arrival of the First Fleet, Australia, with its relatively small population, developing economy and thin capital market, has always been reliant on foreign investment. This remains the case today notwithstanding our emergence as the world's 12th largest economy; an economy which has delivered an extraordinary 23 years of uninterrupted economic growth. Foreign investment has been a key element of this success story—driving successive waves of growth this country has enjoyed in gold, wool, agribusiness and mining.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are of course a resource-rich country. But, in order to exploit this, foreign capital has been required to finance the shortfalls in our own savings and investment to support project construction and ultimately production. Continued waves of investment remain critical as we seek to diversify our economy and to reduce our reliance on any one sector, regardless of how strong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Foreign investment supports the expansion of our businesses and industries and the creation of jobs and has helped build the enviable standards of living we enjoy today as a nation. It also supports Australia's involvement in global value chains, drives innovation and productivity and helps us remain competitive in increasingly competitive global markets. Put simply, without foreign investment, our productive capacity, employment levels and income would all be significantly lower.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">New foreign capital is required to support this government's ambitious infrastructure program and to further develop those areas of our economy that are clear strengths; the things as a country we do as well as any and better than most. These include agriculture and agribusiness; tourism and hospitality; international education; health, ageing and medical research; obviously resources and energy; and all the services, logistics and high-end manufacturing which cluster around these sectors of great strength. These areas already contribute much to our economy but they have great further potential, particularly given the demand from an exploding middle class across the Asia Pacific—with numbers expected to surge from 600 million to around three billion within 20 years. It is almost incomprehensible, the phenomena that is going on in the region around us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a consequence, this will be the century of food, water and energy security, and Australia is extremely well positioned to take advantage. Northern Australia can play a major role, but again foreign capital is required to help drive its development. This explains why so much of my attention is dedicated to doing everything I can to promote Australia as an attractive investment destination and to encourage its inward flow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The world is in fact awash with capital in search of a home, but the economic and geopolitical uncertainty that worries people around the globe has seriously impacted on business confidence in new investment. Risk-taking is much diminished. An investment environment of certainty and stability is more important than ever. This is why the government is determined to do everything reasonably possible to ensure Australia is viewed by the world as a stable, certain, attractive investment destination; as a country that is indeed 'open for business'.</span>

The other main part of foreign investment is investment of a portfolio nature, such as diversified investments into equities or long-term bonds by international investors here—and I will come back to this other part of investment in a moment.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The total amount (or stock) of 'direct investment' in Australia reached A$630 billion in 2013—40 per cent higher than in 2008. Traditionally—and still today—the bulk of our stock of direct investment is held by investors from developed countries like the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan. In 2013, the United States was the largest total investor here, holding $149 billion—or nearly a quarter of the stock of all direct investment in Australia. The United Kingdom was second at $87 billion, with nearly 14 per cent of total direct investment. Japan was third at $63 billion, with 10 per cent of the total direct investment. But, increasingly, foreign investment is now coming from emerging markets in Asia. Australia is a leading destination for Chinese investment, for example. China is now our sixth-largest source of inward foreign direct investment, holding three per cent of the total stock, with A$21 billion. China's surge is set to continue.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">For Australia, direct foreign investment means more jobs. One in five businesses in Australia with more than 200 employees are at least 50 per cent foreign owned. And foreign investors often deliver high-quality jobs. US majority owned affiliates in Australia, for example, pay wages well in excess of the average wage. According to a database of announced foreign direct investment transactions published by <span style="font-style:italic;">The Financial Times</span>, in the five years to July, there were 1,635 investment projects in Australia. These attracted US$100 billion in capital expenditure and generated over 140,000 jobs.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As mentioned earlier, this government is committed to attracting more foreign investment. This explains our aggressive domestic reform agenda, which is aimed at improving Australia's 'ease of doing business'. We are working to restore Australia's reputational 'gold standard', which sadly slipped under our predecessors. We are removing the damaging taxes—the carbon tax and the mining tax have been repealed. I know that these measures alone have dramatically improved our standing among serious international investors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are committed to a serious attack on red and green tape to the value of $1 billion each year. Already, through our first repeal day in March, we cut more than 10,000 pieces of regulation and legislation and more than 50,000 pages were deleted from the statute book. This will save over $700 million in compliance costs across the economy every year. More will be on its way in the next repeal day in October.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also streamlining approval processes for major projects through the 'one-stop shop' initiative. This will reduce duplication between states, territories and the Commonwealth and save time, which is money for businesses and investors. The time for a large $30 billion LNG project approval, for instance, has drifted out by up to two years since 2007, and at a cost of $30 million to $40 million a month that puts a huge millstone around the neck of our competitiveness for a resource which is going to be in huge demand in the years ahead. The environment minister has already, in a most responsible way, approved in the order of 300 projects, including 94 in resources, worth $800 billion in economic value—some of which had stalled for six years under our predecessors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also committed to restoring the rule of law in the construction industry to stamp out rogue union behaviour, which undermines investment and productivity. The last time that we introduced a building and construction commission we saw a $7 billion increase in productivity. We are investing a record $50 billion in infrastructure, which will help leverage $125 billion worth of projects, including road and rail. And we are driving an innovative asset recycling program with incentives for the states and territories to privatise assets and infrastructure. Again, this has captured the imagination of international investors, including, for example, the major pension funds of Canada and the big investment houses in New York.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the free trade agreements we have recently concluded with Korea and Japan, we have also dramatically increased the private investment screening threshold to $1.078 billion, the same level that applies to the United States and New Zealand. This is the non-discriminatory approach we are looking to take in future trade agreements which reduces the regulatory burden for investors.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also committed to major reviews of competition policy and the taxation policy through a comprehensive tax white paper process. Already, the government's pro-investment approach is having a material impact. The Chair of China Merchants Group, Liming Yu, wrote to me advising of the company's $1.75 billion investment with Hastings in the Port of Newcastle. He wrote:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">One of the key factors that gave us confidence in making such a significant investment in Australia is the proactive approach your ministry has taken in attracting foreign investments and your commitment of providing an open, fair and level playing field for all the investors to invest in Australia.</span>

                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />Likewise, the chairman of China's powerful National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) told the Treasurer and me during a visit in June that Australia's investment environment had improved a great deal over the last 12 months.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As mentioned, we have also sent a strong signal in regard to our support for the development of northern Australia, with a white paper being advanced. I have made no secret of my belief that there are massive significant untapped opportunities waiting for us in northern Australia. But, if we are to win the capital that will unlock the North, we must have a regulatory framework that is attractive to and reliable for business. Next year I will host a major forum in the North for some of the world's biggest investors to showcase the opportunity and investment-ready projects. Infrastructure requirements will be a major focus.</span>

We are taking a true 'Team Australia' approach working hand in hand with state and territory governments to attract investment. In February of this year, I chaired the inaugural meeting of Commonwealth and state and territory trade and investment ministers and in September I chaired the second meeting in Cairns.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In tourism, we have major prospects ahead. With the rise of the Asian middle class, tourism will be a major driver of growth. By 2020, almost 200 million Chinese tourists are expected to travel internationally, a doubling of current numbers in just the next five years. Australia is well placed to capitalise on this rising demand. But we need significant investment in tourism infrastructure if we are to realise our potential in that market. That huge potential lies particularly at the high-value, high-margin end. We are a high-cost country and in order to get a return that warrants the investment, we need to pitch so much of what we do, including in tourism, at the high-value end. We require something like 20,000 new and upgraded rooms. Funds are already starting to flow. There are reports of $20 billion in prospective investment in high-quality Australian tourism infrastructure, which includes five-star integrated resorts near Cairns, in Brisbane and also on the Gold Coast. Hong Kong-listed Far East Consortium International was recently announced as the successful bidder for the Elizabeth Quay Lot 9 &amp; 10 project in Western Australia. Construction is valued at more than $350 million—and something like 1,000 jobs will be created.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In agribusiness, Australia is exceptionally well placed to help meet Asia's massive, emerging demand for safe, premium food and fibre—again, at the premium end of the market. ANZ estimates we stand to capture up to $1.7 trillion in 2011 dollars in new agricultural exports out to 2050. But we will need investment, including foreign investment, to make this happen. And it is happening.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last week, I witnessed a signing ceremony held for the establishment of the Beijing Australia Agricultural Resource Cooperative Development Fund. The fund is planning to invest around $3 billion in capital in various Australian agricultural projects, including in dairy, particularly infant formula, and in beef, lamb, seafood and other products. This has followed some eight meetings I have had with the companies involved over nine months.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In another example, Italian chocolatier Ferrero recently made an A$70 million investment to set up a hazelnut plantation of one million trees on 2,000 hectares in the Riverina region in NSW. This spread of investment type is exceptional and presents enormous opportunities. Invariably all of this new investment brings different perspectives and invariably a lot of IP, which again we share in. It makes our work force more skilful and makes our ventures more innovative, and it keeps us at the forefront of trade and investment. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In resources and energy, we know Australia's prospects remain bright, particularly in areas like LNG. There are major new projects that offer 25- to 50-year lifespans, in oil, gas and mining. The recent approval of Adani Mining's Carmichael coal mine and rail infrastructure project in Queensland offers something like 2,500 construction-phase jobs. It will open up the Galilee Basin, which has been spoken about for 40 years. It is the first new province for coal development in 40 years. And 4,000 ongoing operations positions will be part of that project. The project has a resource value of $300 billion over 60 years. By the way, that project will provide electricity for 100 million Indians for 90 years, so we are providing a humanitarian outcome as well as a commercial outcome for Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Equally, we are keen to draw investment into our advanced manufacturing and services sectors. So we can continue to develop great Australian products that have global significance—like penicillin, the bionic ear, wi-fi, the cervical cancer vaccine Gardasil, and so on. The proposed $20 billion health endowment fund for future medical research and development is prompting major international investment interest.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Boeing's investment in a new R&amp;D facility in Port Melbourne, Victoria, is a great example of how Australian R&amp;D capability is attracting the attention of major multinationals.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And in infrastructure, we simply do not have enough capital to fund all the projects that we need to truly link Australia to the world, to tap into global best practice and maximise our economic growth. According to the Business Council of Australia, we have an infrastructure need of more than $760 billion. That sort of funding simply cannot be obtained locally. The A$1.5 billion Legacy Way Project in Brisbane is a great example of foreign investors partnering with a local firm to reduce costs and introduce innovation in the development of Australian infrastructure.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my role I travel frequently and use all visits abroad as opportunities to promote Australia to major investors. Since coming to office, I have conducted 40 major investment roundtables in 16 countries, including most recently in India. For example, one roundtable in the United States had five investment funds representing well over $1 trillion in funds under management. I had two hours to sell Australia to investors who had never had any contact with Australian governments in the past. Likewise, in Canada, I had a roundtable with major pension funds representing nearly $500 billion. And I have received strong interest in Australia from around the globe, particularly out of financial centres in Asia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:24</span>):  Labor supports foreign investment. We see foreign investment as one way to create the jobs and to create the opportunities that might not otherwise be created or be made available in our economy. Our engagement with the world has made Australia a more competitive, a more productive and a more prosperous nation. As others have said, including the Minister for Trade and Investment today, we are a capital-hungry country and there is a lot of capital looking for a home around the world. We do not have in Australia sufficient capital to maintain the sort of employment opportunities and living standards that Australians have a right to expect and that Australians deserve. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The benefits of an open market have flowed to everyday Australians through lower consumer prices and increased employment opportunities. Labor knows that we will not improve living standards and opportunities for working people by pulling down the shutters on the world, so we do support foreign investment. Subject to the right arrangements and subject to the right protections, we do want a more open Australian economy. We are the ones who believe very deeply that it is possible to combine economic expansion and Asian integration and opportunities for a greater number of Australians here at home. This is effectively the Keating model that so many of us on this side of the House see as an article of faith. Some of us joined the Labor Party to advance the cause of, for example, Asian integration and a more open economy and to do so in a way that gives our people more opportunities to prosper. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor does have a really proud record when it comes to investment. Contrary to a lot of the commentary that you hear from the government<span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:Tahoma;&#xD;&#xA;  ">'</span>s cheerleaders, there was an investment boom under the Labor government despite a global financial crisis. In the minister's own statement, he refers to a really stunning statistic—and I do congratulate him for informing the House of this statistic, because it is important. Between 2008 and 2013—so for the period of the former Labor government—there was an investment boom. Foreign direct investment was up 40 per cent over that period, which is an extraordinary amount of growth and something that we are very proud of on this side of the House. I think the whole nation should be proud of the way that Australia has attracted that level of foreign investment. Unfortunately, for the government and for the minister, it undermines the rest of his argument that Labor was in some way an impediment to this kind of investment. There was an investment boom under Labor. His own speech refers to 40 per cent growth in foreign direct investment under Rudd and Gillard. It is extraordinary that he would then go on to make his partisan points about Labor, having already quoted the key statistic. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud in my own personal sense to have been involved in some of these foreign investment decisions in a former role working with the member for Lilley, the member for McMahon and the member for Maribyrnong—the Treasurer and various Assistant Treasurers over that period. I was proud that we took such a pro-investment stance when it came to many of the applications that came before us as a government. So I do thank the minister for mentioning that crucial stat about the growth in foreign direct investment under the former Labor government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course I do not have time to go through it in detail here, but the Asian century white paper was also geared towards how we would become a more attractive destination for investment here in Australia, in the most dynamic region in the global economy, which is, of course, Asia. How do we attract investment from these countries that are becoming not just big exporters of capital but also big consumers so that we have this virtuous cycle of investment and trade in our region. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was also good of the minister to mention 23 years of consecutive economic growth in Australia. That is almost a quarter-century of economic growth and continuous expansion in the Australian economy—every Australian should be proud of that fact—with half of it under us and half of it under our opponents across the table here. It is worth mentioning that whenever we think of that quarter-century of continuous economic expansion in our economy, we should pay tribute again to the reforms put in place by the Keating and Hawke governments and also by the efforts that all Australians put in, including the government, in saving Australia from the global recession. Without the Keating reforms, without the stimulus and all the other factors that helped us over that difficult period in the global economy, those 23 years—entering 24 now—would not have been possible. So I think that, with our credentials as attractors of foreign investment and our economic record, we do come to this conversation with some credibility. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also take a national interest approach to these questions. It is the only way to go. It is no use conducting these debates in an overly partisan way. It is of course our responsibility to highlight the flaws in each other's arguments. But this is after all about Australian prosperity, and we should always take a national interest approach to these sorts of questions. I think it is wonderful to hear from the minister for trade, for example, about the success that he might have in some of these forums. We support him touting Australia's wares around the world; that is the job of a trade and investment minister. As patriots first and partisans second we do want Australia to succeed in the global economy. We do want to have that success. We do want to have that prosperity. We do want to create jobs. So, where we can, we support the government. So we do not disagree with everything the minister said; we disagree with parts of what the minister said. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of things we do disagree on is that we believe being 'open for business' should be more than just hanging a sign on a lectern. We need to be serious about it. You are not serious about it if you are hopelessly split as a party on decisions like the GrainCorp decision, which was a shocking decision for Australia. There was not a single mention of it in the minister's statement. When I was flicking through the minister's statement, I thought that a page had dropped out because there was nothing in there about GrainCorp, which was the most significant and detrimental decision that the government has taken when it comes to foreign investment, and I want to go through that in detail in a moment. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">You are not serious about foreign investment if you have members like the member for Higgins denigrating the Foreign Investment Review Board, in the Treasurer's portfolio. I thought that they were disgraceful multiple interventions from the member for Higgins when she was running down Brian Wilson, who is a top servant of Australia, who runs the Foreign Investment Review Board, in the Treasurer's portfolio—not a peep from the Treasurer to defend his own Foreign Investment Review Board. You are not serious about foreign investment if you attack the confidence that overseas investors might have in that body. You can say what you want about their resourcing, you can even say what you want about their decisions, but for the member for Higgins to get into Brian Wilson about a lack of leadership, I think, sends the wrong message to the rest of the world. It would not surprise me entirely of some members opposite agreed with me. I would hope that the Treasurer would agree with me, given that the FIRB is in his own portfolio. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">With regard to what we heard from the Minister for Trade and Investment today, as I said before, there were some things we agree with and some things that we disagree with. We think that the most important thing that you need to contemplate when you are talking about being 'open for business' is not just the rhetoric, as important as that can be in some of these international fora, but also the decisions made, and I do want to spend some time on the inconsistency of those opposite when it comes to foreign investment.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Abbott government failed its first test on foreign investment when it blocked the proposed takeover of GrainCorp by Archer Daniels Midland. Not only did the government block the takeover but it has been completely inconsistent in its reasons for doing so, showing that it is making up investment policy on the run. It is noteworthy that the minister mentioned the First Fleet in his statement but not the Treasury decision on that foreign investment proposal. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In April this year, the Treasurer claimed that he had blocked ADM's proposed takeover of GrainCorp because the American company was of 'not particularly good character'. The Treasurer's extraordinary claim was made public five months after blocking the ADM investment and raises serious questions about the transparency and fairness of the government's approach to foreign investment. This sorry saga of confusion and contradiction on ADM's proposed $3.4 billion investment gives the lie to the government's claim that Australia is open for business. The Treasurer and the Minister for Trade and Investment have made a series of inconsistent statements about ADM's proposed acquisition of GrainCorp. When the Treasurer announced he was blocking the deal last November, he cited national interest grounds and the impact on competition and made no mention whatsoever of the character grounds that he has since talked about. Then, in March this year, the Minister for Trade and Investment told an investor conference the decision to block the takeover was just a signal that the deal's timing was wrong and that 'there may be an opportunity at some stage' for ADM to renew its bid for GrainCorp. A month later, the Treasurer made a new claim when he said that one of the reasons it was knocked back was concern about the company's character. Given this claim was made so long after the decision to knock it back, we do wonder whether ADM was given the opportunity to respond. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the Abbott government wants to show some leadership and find some consistency on foreign investment, it could start by providing a coherent explanation for that particular shambles. As the BCA's chief executive, Jennifer Westacott, said at the time of the ADM decision, certainty about Australia's foreign investment policy and transparency in communicating the reasons for decisions are important for global confidence in Australia. Inconsistent and incoherent behaviour by the government on major investment proposals will erode Australia's reputation as an investment destination, which will be bad news for jobs and growth. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to the Treasurer's retrograde decision against ADM, we also have the tail wagging the dog inside the coalition party room, with the imposition of new and arbitrary limits on investments in agricultural land. The minister talks big when he is on the phone to financial journalists, but he cannot stare down the Nats in his own joint party room. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a speech to the Economic and Social Outlook Conference in Melbourne in July, Labor's shadow minister for trade and investment, Senator Penny Wong, outlined Labor's ambitious approach to lifting the thresholds on foreign investment. Australia has always built its economy with investment funded by a mixture of domestic and overseas capital. We agree, as I said before, with the minister that our economy is capital hungry and it does rely on foreign investment to create jobs and business opportunities and to boost growth. As part of a comprehensive agreement delivering real market access gains and dealing responsibly with the labour movement, Labor is inclined to support China enjoying the same investment thresholds as the United States. That means a threshold of just over a billion dollars for Foreign Investment Review Board screening of proposed investments in non-sensitive sectors. Lower thresholds should continue to apply for investments in sensitive sectors or by state owned enterprises where issues of national interest can arise. The proposed treatment of state owned enterprises must be outlined by the minister before any agreement is signed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor does not agree with the Abbott government's policy of imposing more restrictive rules on foreign investment in agriculture. As Penny Wong has said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">If we are serious about significantly expanding our food exports to Asia, we must front up to the reality and necessity of foreign investment in our agricultural sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is inconceivable that we will be able to scale up production to fully tap into the growing consumer markets of Asia without foreign investment.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Placing hurdles in the way of foreign investment in our primary production industries will only jeopardise their growth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That is why Chinese investment in agriculture should be treated in the same way as investment in other non-sensitive sectors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Looking further ahead, once Australia has a $1 billion-plus threshold for FIRB screening for investors from the United States, Korea, China and New Zealand, it is hard to see why we should discriminate against other major trading partners.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Robb has also cited the increased threshold for these countries in his statement, but Labor believes that Australia should consider unilaterally extending the FIRB screening rules offered to these FTA partners to all countries. Just like domestic investments, foreign investment proposals would still need approval from competition and corporate regulators to maintain competitive markets and protect shareholder interests, and for proposals worth more than $1 billion, the government would retain its powers to scrutinise investments on national interest grounds. But for a country that thrives on investment, it makes no sense to impose unnecessary red tape or barriers to investors looking to build businesses and create jobs legitimately in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has a proud record when it comes to foreign investment. We in Labor understand that foreign investment means growth and jobs when it comes to broader measures to open up our economy. Over the years, Labor trade ministers from John Dawkins and Peter Cook to Simon Crean and my own predecessor Craig Emerson have played important roles in dismantling protectionist barriers. Labor wants to see more opening up of our economy on a wider range of fronts, with deeper integration into our region and into the world, because this will deliver growth for Australia and will improve living standards for working people. If Australian policy makers handle this shift intelligently they will deliver great economic benefits for future Australian generations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Gillard government's Asian century white paper set the goal of ensuring that Australia's economy becomes more integrated with Asia, with goods and services, capital, ideas and people flowing more readily between Australia and the economies of our region. If this can be achieved there will be tremendous opportunities for Australian businesses and investors in countries like China and India. But it will not just happen by itself. It will require getting a raft of policies right, not just in trade but also in industry and innovation, education and science, investment and infrastructure. Unfortunately, in so many of these areas billions of dollars have been cut from investment right across the board. To be serious about boosting Australia's trade performance, it is necessary to be serious about boosting productivity and competitiveness. Declaring that Australia is open for business requires more than signage on a lectern. We need continuing economic reform.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor wants an innovative, competitive, dynamic and outward-looking Australian economy. We want to think more broadly about the kind of country that other companies around the world would want to invest in. The minister outlined some of those factors that companies around the world take into account. We think that that shopping list of policy measures was characteristically narrow and exclusive and an excuse to pursue some pet ideologies. To give a speech about investment and not to mention superannuation, to be the minister for investment and not talk up super in our economy, is bizarre in the extreme. Anyone who knows anything about this sort of stuff knows that that combination of foreign and domestic investment—that capital—comes not only from overseas but also from our own super funds and other sources. I think if we are going to have a minister for investment he should understand and should value and should treasure the role of superannuation in our economy, including the role of superannuation in helping Australia get through the global financial crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing we want to hear from the government is that a lot of companies around the world want to invest in a country where the people are smart and well trained and where there has been substantial, proper investment in the human capital of a nation. To be attracted to Australia, people want to know that they are investing in a country full of dynamic, adaptive and resilient people. That goes to some of the unfortunate, disappointing and devastating reforms to the higher education system proposed by the Minister for Education which will price some people out of the market. Those opposite do not have a great understanding of people who are vulnerable in our community. Some people will finish high school and they will think about higher education, but they will decide against it on the basis that they do not want to owe Chris Pyne $100,000, they do not want to take all their life to pay back that money and they do not want to choose between a higher education—a degree—and buying a house or starting a family. The massive majority of the Australian people are with Labor on that issue.</span>

What I mean is that when we are talking about foreign investment we need to make people understand that foreign investment is a big opportunity for Australia and that its benefits need to be more broadly felt. We need more people to be able to grasp the benefits of prosperity in our country. That means we need to do a better job—all sides of politics, anyone involved in the public conversation—of explaining to the Australian people the benefits of foreign investment and the benefits of opening up our economy so that those who adopt a reflexively defensive position do not dominate the debate. I think probably we could agree, and I am sure the minister would agree, that it needs constant effort on both sides of politics and all parts of the country to consistently sell the benefits of that effort if you do believe in foreign investment and in opening up the economy.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister mentioned before the global value chains that are dominating the trade structure of the global economy right now, particularly in our own region. When we talk about foreign investment and trade we want to make sure that we are training our people for the best parts of those global value chains. We want to be at the good end; we want to be at the high-wage, high-skill end of those global value chains. I think that is a worthy aspiration for a First World, first-rate country like ours. We cannot compete with other countries on wages. We cannot win a race to the bottom. So it is important that we are training our people up for the best parts of those global value chains.</span>

We welcome the opportunity to engage on these issues, and we thank the minister for the opportunity to respond.</span>

The project will enhance current ADF capability to combat the ongoing threat to our personnel operating in areas of conflict. These works form part of the first phase of Project JP154, and I note that the Minister for Defence announced first-pass approval for phase 2 of this project yesterday. As the minister noted in that announcement, the use of improvised explosive devices is increasing globally and they are being employed by a range of groups, including insurgents, terrorists, and conventional and unconventional military forces.</span>

The facilities that are the subject of this referral will support research and development, engineering acceptance and testing, and storage and training for force protection electronic countermeasures equipment. The facilities will be located at a number of existing Defence locations across Australia, with the most significant works to be undertaken at Nurrungar and Edinburgh in South Australia. The works are valued at $24.6 million, excluding GST. This includes provision for management and design, construction, furniture, fittings and equipment, contingencies, and escalation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Department of Defence is proposing to construct a space surveillance telescope facility at the Naval Communication Station Harold E. Holt in Exmouth, Western Australia. The facility is the cornerstone of a Space Situational Awareness Partnership between Australia and the United States of America, announced in November 2010 following the Australia-United States Ministerial, or AUSMIN, Conference. At the 2012 AUSMIN, both governments agreed to work towards locating a space surveillance telescope on Australian soil. Space is becoming increasingly congested, with active satellites and discarded space junk posing a collision risk to space assets. Space situational awareness will give the operators of space based capabilities the ability to anticipate the influence of other space objects and to take action to ensure continued and unimpeded operations of space vehicles.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The project is valued at $63 million, excluding GST. This includes all design and construction delivery costs, including furniture and fittings, equipment, contingencies, and escalation. The facility will be located within an existing Defence facility, the Naval Communication Station Harold E. Holt near Exmouth, which offers the best conditions for optimal telescope functionality of the sites available. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to begin in early 2015 and to be completed by mid-2016. I commend the motion to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:52</span>):  At the last election the coalition promised to apply cost-benefit analysis to infrastructure projects worth more than $100 million. The Infrastructure Australia Amendment (Cost Benefit Analysis and Other Measures) Bill 2014 provides cover for a breach of that promise. Once again this government has treated its election promises like plates at Greek wedding. Labor will support this bill but with amendments to keep the government to its promises, to ensure that there is proper value for taxpayers for infrastructure investment and that we get the right infrastructure investment to boost productivity. These amendments are consistent with the approach we have taken on earlier legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation purports to require proper cost-benefit analysis for major infrastructure projects to help decide whether they are worth the investment of scarce public dollars. But it comes, of course, more than two months after this minister handed out $3½ billion for two road projects that have not been the subject of proper cost-benefit analysis. I speak here of the Westconnex road project in Sydney and Melbourne's East West Link. Even worse, the government has obtained the funding for these untested projects by cancelling approved funding for two critical public transport projects which have been the subject of full analysis by Infrastructure Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Far from creating a proper process, the legislation before us will institutionalise this retrospective cost-benefit analysis. Retrospective cost-benefit analysis is by definition next to useless. This legislation requires cost-benefit analysis only after the allocation of more than $100 million of taxpayers' funds to a particular project. So instead of doing the analysis, finding out what the benefit is of a particular project, doing comparative analysis of projects that are submitted to Infrastructure Australia, then determining a payment could be made and then making milestone payments upon delivering on the objectives of the project, this legislation does the opposite. You pay the money first—over $100 million—and then you do the analysis to decide whether it was a good idea or not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government says it wants expert opinion to help it decide how to spend money effectively, but it is legislating to make that advice irrelevant. The minister is in effect legislating to entrench his breaches of his election promises of cost-benefit analysis before funding is allocated—fund now, check later. This is a bizarre proposition from this government. Labor will seek to amend this bill to make it clear that infrastructure project selection starts with a measurement of cost benefit prior to any decision to fund. This is consistent with Labor's approach to the Building Australia Fund, where projects are required to be prior assessed by Infrastructure Australia. Labor will achieve this by making the $100 million about the capital value of the project rather than how much funding has been earmarked to it. This amendment will also ensure that projects nominated by the minister for evaluation are also assessed by Infrastructure Australia. Labor will also move to amend the Land Transport Infrastructure Act to make Infrastructure Australia assessment a pre-requisite for funding projects over $100 million in value. Finally, we will move amendments to require a standard method for cost-benefit analysis and to strengthen transparency. The government, if it is fair dinkum, should support these amendments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In his contribution to this debate the Minister for Infrastructure said this:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To maximise productivity improvement through investment, funding must flow to projects that yield the highest benefits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister went on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is critical to base project selection on rigorous analysis and sound planning to avoid wasteful investment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course the minister was right, which is why it makes complete sense to check out the bona fides of the project before providing funding. If that were the effect of this bill, it would have my unqualified support, but that is not the effect of this bill—the opposite is so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this bill, by the time experts have given their opinion on the economics of investing in a particular project the funding will have already been provided. While the experts weigh up costs and benefits, ministers of this government will already be out there spruiking a project. The people of Australia have lately become accustomed to this government treating its election commitments with contempt, but what is truly remarkable in this case is the way in which this minister is continuing to pretend that he is delivering on these promises. In his contribution to this debate the minister said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">IA is already assessing projects which involve Commonwealth funding of at least $100 million and will make public the details of the valuations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This was the Government's election commitment and this is what we are delivering without the trigger being specific in legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem with this is twofold: the fact that the minister is saying that IA are assessing projects that have already received funding—which speaks for itself—but it is very different from what the government actually promised. Just two days before the election the coalition released its infrastructure policy so there could not be much scrutiny before 7 September. It said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To ensure more rigorous and transparent assessments of taxpayer-funded projects we will require all infrastructure projects worth more than $100 million to undergo a cost-benefit analysis … Infrastructure Australia will also be required to calculate and publish the net present value of recommended infrastructure projects and to justify why a given project has been recommended and prioritised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the policy and it could not be clearer. I support that policy; it is what we put into practice in government and it can only be interpreted the cost-benefit analysis should take place first. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not as though the government said one thing before the election and another afterwards. After the election, on 12 September, the minister told Infrastructure Partnerships Australia:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Infrastructure Australia will publish its reports on its website as transparent advice for the Government to consider when allocating its infrastructure funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister made clear that that would be when, not after, it was making the decision. That is why the legislation today is so flawed. Within months of the government being elected the Prime Minister had gone from speaking about proper analysis to calling proper analysis, to quote him, 'analysis paralysis'. That was the term he used to justify not sticking to the commitment made prior to the election just as he said, prior to the election, that there would be no cuts to health or education or pensions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister's position as outlined in this bill also entrenches his absurd refusal to invest in public transport. Given that the bill requires cost-benefit analysis after funding is allocated and the fact that the government refuses to fund any new public transport project, we can conclude that Infrastructure Australia will never be asked to conduct a cost-benefit analysis on any public transport project. We know that that will reinforce what the Productivity Commission and others have said is a result of this government's policy. That is, not only is the federal government's refusal to fund any public transport project bringing that figure down to zero but, of course, states are responding by also reducing their funding for public transport projects, because they are seeking to prioritise projects that will attract some co-funding from the federal government. Therefore, where they have before them two projects, a road project and a rail project, common sense—as well as the Productivity Commission, Infrastructure Australia and others—tells you that they will fund the road project and not the public transport projects.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We created Infrastructure Australia to take the politics out of infrastructure delivery, to break the nexus between the political cycle, which by definition is three or four years, and the infrastructure investment cycle, which is long-term. We inherited an enormous infrastructure deficit. When we came to office Australia was ranked 20th in the OECD for infrastructure investment as a proportion of the national economy. When we left office we were ranked first. Australia went from 20th to first over those six years. We invested not just in any project; we invested in the right projects. We invested in all 15 projects that were identified by Infrastructure Australia. Infrastructure Australia also ensured that there was more rigour in state government processes. Quite frankly, the states had in the past been negligent in doing the proper planning work and getting that up to scratch. For example, when the global financial crisis hit and there was an opportunity for projects to be funded to stimulate the economy and to see us through that crisis, there were very few projects that were actually ready to go, on which the hard work of planning had been done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that Infrastructure Australia also did, and I see nothing wrong with the government doing this, was provide seed funding for state governments, such as the $40 million we provided for the Melbourne Metro project, to see if projects could be got up to speed. It was a dynamic process between Infrastructure Australia and the state governments to make sure that projects could truly deliver on maximising productivity benefits. That dynamic process prior to major funding being delivered was exactly what we envisaged Infrastructure Australia would do, not just doing an analysis after. In this case, $3½ billion was already prepaid last financial year to the Victorian and New South Wales governments. The government has ignored that. It has ignored proper advice. It has ensured that we have a process that is deeply flawed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An example of that is the East West Link project. We asked after the budget, in Senate estimates, where $1½ billion has been allocated—$500 million for stage 1 and $1 billion for stage 2. They cannot even say where the tunnels are coming up. They cannot say precisely what the route of the project is. But $1 billion of taxpayers money was paid, in advance, last financial year. The government says that there is a budget crisis but $1½ billion was paid in advance before a contract has been signed, before plans have been finalised and before a cost-benefit analysis has been published. We have seen only two cost-benefit analyses for the East West Link: one of 0.5—that is, 50c returned for every dollar invested—and one of 0.8, which lifts it up to 80c, if you take into account a whole range of other factors to lift it up as high as possible. After the allocation of that $1½ billion, during the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee's estimates hearing held on 26 May, Senator Conroy asked Infrastructure Australia: </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reply from Mr Roe of Infrastructure Australia was:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That is correct. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, when asked at the same estimates meeting about East West Link stage 2—to which a billion dollars has already been paid—Infrastructure Australia acknowledged that it had only received 'conceptual information'. Mr Fitzgerald from IA said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is significantly more information that we would require for it to be a full business case.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So you have the extraordinary situation that money has been forwarded well in advance of any proper analysis being undertaken.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The independence of Infrastructure Australia is central to Labor's approach to infrastructure delivery. Under this government, however, Infrastructure Australia is already moving away from the independent model it was designed to follow. It started when the minister brought legislation to this House proposing to give himself the right to dictate Infrastructure Australia's research agenda. He also proposed giving himself a right of veto over publication of IA research, which would have destroyed the transparency of the current system. I am pleased to say that Labor, backed by the Business Council of Australia, Infrastructure Partnerships Australia and several other groups, campaigned against these proposals. That led to the government accepting Labor amendments that preserved IA's independence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I do worry about how Infrastructure Australia has been functioning in recent times. We have had a range of new board members appointed, as well as an acting Infrastructure Coordinator—John Fitzgerald. I have asked for information about how the CEO of Infrastructure Australia is going to be chosen. I have asked what advertising is taking place and how the recruitment process for that position is being determined. It is not a position that should be determined politically. Based on what we have seen so far, Mr Fitzgerald can hardly be described as an unbiased analyst. In the budget estimates committee hearing in May, Mr Fitzgerald revealed that he had been with consulting firm KPMG, where he had been a lobbyist for the East West Link project. The job he had prior to that was working on the East West Link project for the Victorian government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Conroy raised this issue and asked at Senate estimates if there were any potential conflicts involved—because it stood out as an obvious one. Challenged about this at the hearing, Mr Fitzgerald declared himself an advocate for major national projects. Infrastructure Australia is not supposed to be an advocate; it is supposed to be an impartial organisation that deals with facts. That is why I was very concerned that, on 29 April, Mr Fitzgerald produced a media release—on Infrastructure Australia letterhead—in which he said that Infrastructure Australia had consistently held the view that the East West Link was a meritorious project. It was quite extraordinary for him, as a public servant, to put out such a press release. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Fitzgerald has since then continued to take an increasingly political approach to what is supposed to be a non-political position. In July, <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Age</span> revealed that an Infrastructure Australia report had questioned the amount of money that was being spent on roads around the nation and had asked whether proper analysis was being conducted in order to maximise the benefit of that investment. This report was a contribution to the debate and was consistent with the way Infrastructure Australia works. It was put out for comment from the sector. Mr Fitzgerald intervened to disown the report, a report which had come from the organisation he was the acting Infrastructure Coordinator of. That is quite extraordinary. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just a few weeks ago there was some controversy about court action that two local councils were taking over the East West Link project. It is, after all, a very controversial project in Victoria—and it should be noted that Victoria is facing an election in the next few months. On the Friday, Mr Fitzgerald again issued a media release—again on Infrastructure Australia letterhead—this time criticising the position that was being advanced by the Labor opposition on the project, in particular the Labor opposition questioning whether, in the circumstances, signing a contract for the project would be legal. I would find it unbelievable if, say, Mike Mrdak, the secretary of the department, or Dr Watt from PM&amp;C or any other senior public servant were to intervene in such a situation. But Mr Fitzgerald did—by putting out a media release. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One has to ask the question: who authorised Mr Fitzgerald's intervention? The Infrastructure Australia board had certainly not met. The government—not the minister, to be fair, but his errand boy, the assistant minister—has been quite critical from time to time about the former Infrastructure Coordinator, Michael Deegan, and in the past has talked a lot about having an independent board at arm's length. It is absolutely extraordinary that this occurred. Mr Fitzgerald, as a former public servant, should frankly know better. You can be a political participant or a public servant. If you want to be a political participant, join a political party and run for public office. But do not be an acting public servant in a senior position who behaves in such an extraordinary fashion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is my concern with regard to proper processes. Similarly, with the WestConnex project in Sydney, we in government were of the view that there is a real argument to extend the M4 from where it currently finishes through to the city. It is absurd that it ends some considerable distance from the city and then people, after being on the M4, hit a traffic jam. This is just like how the M5, which I have also been critical of, needs to be extended to the port.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />Indeed, the current Prime Minister identified this objective in his book <span style="font-style:italic;">Battlelines</span><span style="font-style:italic;">. </span>He said this:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Sydney, for instance, should fill the gaps between the CBD and the M4 at Strathfield... There should be a link between the northern beaches and the city and between the western suburbs at Port Botany.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you look at the contribution of Mr Tony Shepherd—and I have raised my concerns with Tony Shepherd, as the head of WestConnex—the problem is at the moment, as they themselves say, the proposed stage 1 is an extension to Haberfield and the proposed stage 2 is an extension to St Peters. This is a road to a traffic jam. This does not solve the problem. Anyone who drives to Sydney Airport will know that the idea of dumping traffic to the west of Sydney Airport, let alone not taking it to the port, is extraordinary. King Street in Newtown is a car park. This is a road to a car park. It is not dealing with the productivity benefits that would be dealt with, in terms of a freight link from Port Botany—which would see such growth—through to the M5.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  " />In terms of the M4, there is extraordinary uncertainty being created for my constituents and for the people of Western Sydney, who deserve better than this approach. That example has been exemplified by the correspondence to one of my constituents, Vince Crowe of Haberfield, who received advice on 26 June 2014 from the <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  ">WestC</span><span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  ">onnex </span><span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  ">Delivery </span><span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  ">Authority.</span><span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-family:;&#xD;&#xA;  "> One said that his property was needed to be purchased and the other said that it was not needed.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What should be occurring is the federal government working with the state government to ensure that those objectives are met. We need to make sure that we get this legislation right. The way to get it right is to do the analysis first and then forward the money second, as the project is going along. That is what we did in government and that is the way that you maximise the productivity benefits of infrastructure investment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is one of the key issues that needs to be dealt with in terms of dealing with urban congestion and the other challenges that are there, particularly in our urban communities. The second thing that the government needs to do is to get rid of this bizarre ideological position that it has of not funding public transport and distorting the market. You need to have an integrated transport strategy when you look at issues of how we get better planning in our cities. If you look at just roads funding, you will distort not just what the federal government does but also what the state government does and you will not be able to deal with urban congestion. It is as silly as completely separating looking at how we move people from how we move freight. It is interconnected. People, freight, road and raid are all interconnected. Unless you have a strategy to deal with all of those issues, you will not be successful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regardless of their political perspective, I think Australians will be disappointed by this legislation; but there is an opportunity for the government to get it right by adopting Labor's amendments. I indicate that we are perfectly willing, as always, to engage in constructive discussion with the government about these issues. That is because when Australians decide to invest in a house, they make relevant checks on its title, its susceptibility to flooding, its easements and other important issues. They hire people to produce property reports so that they know the house is in good order. They do that before they purchase a house, not afterwards. That is due diligence and that is common sense. That common-sense approach can certainly apply when you discuss what is the best way for the government to deal with the challenge of dealing with our infrastructure deficit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that in its first year of office the government has failed to begin one new project that it has developed itself should not actually be an excuse for it to engage in a breach of proper policy. We will be voting for our amendments and voting for amended legislation. That is what we want to see happen. The government should reconsider its position and should do nothing more, but also nothing less, than what is consistent with the policy it took to the election.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:22</span>):  I rise today in support of the Infrastructure Australia Amendment (Cost Benefit Analysis and Other Measures) Bill 2014. The coalition is committed to building the infrastructure of the 21st century and is ensuring that this nation has the productive infrastructure that it needs to meet the challenges ahead. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nowhere is this clearer than in Western Sydney, which has a population of some two million people and is one of the fastest-growing regions in our country. The federal government, under the leadership of the infrastructure Prime Minister, has made considerable investments in the infrastructure across our region. Successive state and federal Labor governments have failed the people of Western Sydney through a lack of vision for the future of our region. We need to unleash our potential and ensure that Western Sydney is the economic powerhouse that it deserves to be. In fact, Western Sydney is our nation's third-largest city. We from Western Sydney believe in our region and, finally, we now have a Prime Minister, a cabinet, a Premier, and state and federal governments that too believe in us.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support this amendment bill as it will ensure the projects in Western Sydney will be delivered effectively and efficiently under the guidance of Infrastructure Australia. By way of background, Infrastructure Australia is a statutory authority and its role is to plan and coordinate projects across Australia. It was established by the former Rudd government in 2008 and it was designed to take the politics out of infrastructure investment. Infrastructure Australia is regarded as a good policy decision; however—unsurprisingly, like so many of the initiatives of the former government—it has been poorly implemented. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under its previous structure, state governments considered Infrastructure Australia to be a political institution because the coordinator was a direct appointment of the federal minister. As a result, state governments disengaged with Infrastructure Australia, which undermined its purpose and overarching goals. To rectify this concern, the government has changed the legislation so Infrastructure Australia has an independent board who appoints a CEO. This is just the first step in meeting our election commitment to create a strong, independent and transparent Infrastructure Australia. I am pleased to note that these new arrangements came into effect on 1 September, and I congratulate the Deputy Prime Minister for moving so quickly to implement this. In introducing this amendment bill, the Deputy Prime Minister has not only strengthened the independence of Infrastructure Australia but also entrenched its role as a key adviser to the government.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The parliament must reach a consensus. Infrastructure Australia needs to move away from assessing lists based on already announced priorities and focus strategically on Australia's future infrastructure needs. Quite simply, Infrastructure Australia should inform decisions rather than play catch-up. Therefore, upon being elected, the government immediately tasked Infrastructure Australia with three key priorities: firstly, undertake an audit of nationally significant infrastructure; secondly, develop a 15-year plan on infrastructure priorities; and, finally, assess projects receiving government funding of $100 million or more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill cements these key priorities. It also goes one step further by ensuring the effective and efficient delivery of infrastructure across Australia by requiring Infrastructure Australia to conduct a cost-benefit analysis on a project before it can appear on a priority list. This move alone will create greater transparency, informing the public of how decisions are being made by government and ensuring that the taxpayer is getting the best value for money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, the cost-benefit analysis will significantly enhance Infrastructure Australia's capability to provide strategic independent advice on the needs of our local communities directly to federal and state government as well as private investors. This means more informed decision making by the government and better outcomes for our local communities. For instance, the government this year ended 40 years of indecision by deciding to build a second Sydney airport at Badgerys Creek. The Prime Minister and cabinet did not just decide to build the airport; they have also put $3.5 billion into an infrastructure plan across Greater Western Sydney. They have worked in a collaborative way with the New South Wales state government to put in place this fully costed plan.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally we have a government which understands the challenges that come with growth in our suburban communities and is delivering the infrastructure that will support our growth today but also into the future. The government has also developed a comprehensive infrastructure plan that will include new infrastructure like WestConnex and NorthConnex; the upgrade of existing roads like Northern Road, Bringelly Road and Elizabeth Drive; and, finally, the reservation of corridors where future infrastructure will be required in the long term. This multifaceted approach will unlock economic capacity and potential by creating Sydney road networks. It will slash travel times for motorists and ease congestion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like Western Sydney, Australia's future growth will be significantly influenced by our capacity to deliver more appropriate, efficient and effective infrastructure and transport. Investment in significant infrastructure is central to growing productivity and improving the living standards of Australians now in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Lindsay, two-thirds of the workforce must commute every single day for work—one-third all the way into the city and one-third into Greater Western Sydney. This $3.5 billion of infrastructure will link so many of our business parks, which is sure to create more jobs locally, get more people off our roads and keep more people within our region. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian and New South Wales governments are also steaming ahead with delivering world-class infrastructure right across Sydney, starting with the geotechnical investigations on the tunnel sections of the WestConnex stage 1 project. The east corridor commenced last week. This is an important milestone in the delivery of WestConnex which will, when it is completed in 2023, provide more than $20 billion in economic benefits to New South Wales, create 10,000 jobs, and help motorists bypass up to 52 sets of traffic lights. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reforms to Infrastructure Australia will ensure the Nepean Valley, Western Sydney and communities right across Australia will benefit from investment in high-quality, efficient and cost-effective infrastructure. This will be achieved through Infrastructure Australia conducting rigorous and sound planning to identify quality projects and avoid wasteful investment. Let us be clear: Infrastructure Australia will not—</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:30</span>):  The people of Newcastle are worried about what the Abbott Liberal government is doing to our national healthcare system. In June and July this year, I conducted a survey of my electorate, asking the community what mattered most to them and what issues most concerned them about this year's budget. The results clearly showed that the issue most important to the people of Newcastle is having access to affordable health care. And the budget issues that concerned responders most were the government's cuts to health and education, coupled with the new tax on visiting the GP and the increased cost of medicines. One responder wrote:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I am a single pensioner as my husband died at 47. I am against extra payments to see the GP. I am constantly at the doctors and I am under 5 specialists. I have had 4 breast cancers and many other problems and have one and a half pages of medications. If Medicare is cut I will not be able to take my medication. It won't affect Tony Abbott as he can afford it. I and lots of pensioners like myself are in the same boat. Save Medicare.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's justification for their cruel attack on Medicare and those less well-off just does not stack up. They say our health bill is spiralling out of control, yet the government's own Australian Institute of Health and Welfare has today reported that growth in health spending is actually at the lowest level in decades. The GP tax is bad for patients, bad for health care and bad for the budget, and the government should scrap it.</span>

The government's policies on health, as communicated so clearly through the priorities in the May budget, are diabolical, short-sighted and ill-informed. The policies make no sense. They are bad for health and they are bad economics. If this government and this health minister were capable of listening to the experts or the public, they would know both those things. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The policies, despite promises of no cuts to health, will see a GP tax, a tax on imaging and tests, more expensive medicines, an undermining of general practitioner business models, an undermining of our universal primary healthcare model and—the icing on the cake—a $50 billion cut to hospitals. The release today of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare annual report on health funding blows their feeble justifications around sustainability out of the water. It in fact proves that Labor's health and hospitals reform agreement with all states and territories, as well as substantial investment in health and medical research, was possible without leading to unsustainable health costs. It proves that investments in facilities like the $30 million invested in the Catherine McAuley subacute rehab centre at the Werribee Mercy Hospital were on the money. Creating and funding the staffing and running investments like this are exactly what the health system needs. When will this health minister and this PM admit to the errors of their ways?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">With those life-changing statistics in mind, I rise today to pay tribute to Ed Howard aka 'the Nightcliff Market Fruit Guy', who retired on Sunday, 31 August after 18 dedicated years selling dried, exotic and mouth-wateringly fresh fruit. Buying fruit from Ed was not just a retail experience; it was an education, and for dozens of regular customers it became a way of life—especially for Nightcliff resident Camden Smith. Ed would say: 'Like pineapple? Then how about the prickly leaf variety—sweeter and juicier than their smooth leaf cousins. Fond of mangoes? Try a mangosteen instead'—described by Ed as the queen of fruit. 'White dragon fruit instead of red? Try it with a squeeze of lime for a tingling taste sensation.'</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  One of the things I am proudest about from Labor's contribution to my own community is the massive Commonwealth investment made by the former Labor government of $175 million in the Logan Hospital expansion project, which is due to open in the next fortnight. I would like to thank the director, staff and management of the hospital for having Catherine King, the member for Ballarat, and Tanya Plibersek, the member for Sydney, visit the new facility over the last couple of months and tour the remarkable new emergency department and children's in-patient unit that was made possible by Labor's investment. The new wing will give local families confidence that they can get the health care they need and that their kids need in the local area, without having to drive all the way into the city. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's record investment in health and hospitals is a mark of great pride. It stands in stark contrast to the $80 billion that the Abbott government is pulling out of hospitals and schools over the next decade. I am advised that over the next four years the Metro South Health network, which includes the Logan Hospital, will lose $26 million in funding. Some members over there try to say that it is not a cut because the hospital has not received the money yet. But it is there in black and white in their budget, and I encourage them to read it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud of Labor's history of investment in hospitals in my community and of the work of our local nurses, doctors and support staff—work that Labor invested in and work that will be made a bit harder by the Abbott government's cuts.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:37</span>):  In Gilmore we are deeply affected by the cost of fuel, especially as our local transport fails to meet the scheduling of timetable needs of residents. Higher fuel prices are of great concern. We have a consistent price differential of 25c to 30c per litre more than suppliers just 45 minutes north. At one point last month, E10 was selling outside Gilmore for $1.31 a litre and just north of Nowra for a massive $1.57 a litre. This just is not good enough, and it is why I met with the Minister for Small Business, the Hon. Bruce Billson, last month. We discussed options for action to fix our regional fuel problem. While Labor gave lip service to this regional issue through the spectacular failure of Fuelwatch and the appointment of a petrol commissioner with no real powers, nothing changed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister is determined that we will not repeat the same mistake of making unrealistic promises when it comes to the cost of fuel, like the previous Labor government did. Yesterday I was pleased to see the minister release the draft report of the Harper competition review, which is the first comprehensive review of Australia's competition law, policy and institutional framework in more than 20 years. I am encouraging all Gilmore residents to make a submission about petrol prices in regional New South Wales.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also commend the minister on the article in yesterday's <span style="font-style:italic;">Telegraph</span>, announcing that the nation's top consumer cop is about to be given a 'bloody great spotlight' to shine on fuel rorts. I look forward to working with him and the government to make sure that residents of the south coast and regional Australians across the country all start to get a fair go on fuel. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

No doubt, prior to his departure and when he arrived, he would have been briefed on the health status of the north-east Arnhem Land community—the Yolngu community—as he was based at Gulkula, just outside of Yirrkala. He would have learned, had he been briefed properly and had he asked, that there is high incidence of diabetes, renal failure and chronic disease across the region and, indeed, across Indigenous populations right across this country. He would have explained, no doubt, that his government had cut $165 million out of health programs dealing with prevention in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.</span>

He did not answer the questions yesterday. He showed yesterday how incompetent he is. We know that this government are not fair dinkum about improving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health outcomes. If they were, they would not be cutting $165 million out of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health programs, particularly those that deal with prevention, such as cutting down on smoking.</span>

Mr Angove was a bus driver for our local Hornibrook Bus Lines, a dedicated employee and a familiar face to his regular commuters. He will be sorely missed. Rod's wife and colleagues joined him yesterday for a celebration of his service—not just to Hornibrook Bus Lines and the community in Petrie but to the entire Queensland transport industry. Rod started out as a mechanic before beginning his 34-year career as a bus driver. He recalled great memories of meeting people daily on his regular routes and revealed that school children who catch buses are not all that bad.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hornibrook Bus Lines is a fantastic community of administrators, bus drivers and mechanics, but it is also a community of local families. The company has just purchased around 60 new buses to be able to better deliver services to locals. And the good news keeps coming. The Queensland government has announced public transport fares are set to drop for the first time ever in the state by five per cent in November, due to the savings from the abolition of the carbon tax. Well done, Rod Angove, and well done, Hornibrook Bus Lines. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Since then, many more constituents have contacted me and signed the petition. They are not alone, of course, in standing up for universal health care and the fundamental principle that sick people ought not be discouraged from seeing their doctor. The AMA, the College of GPs, nurses and the Consumers Health Forum, amongst many others, all agree with my constituents.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recent events show that the position of this government is not just hard-hearted; it is also short-sighted. The government's own Australian Institute of Health and Welfare have produced statistics today which demolish the government's claims. They have belled the cat on this ideological agenda. As the AMA president, Professor Brian Owler, has said, these figures actually show that healthcare spending is certainly not out of control and that there is absolutely no need for them to introduce a GP co-payment. And Professor Stephen Duckett, a former secretary of the health department, says that if just one person in 50 who cannot afford to see a doctor because of the GP tax ends up in hospital all savings would be wiped out. It is mean, short-sighted and, of course, a broken promise. But this GP tax and the threat to universal health care is also breaking a fundamental social compact that Australians treasure and need.</span>

Type 1 diabetes is a serious disease that affects 122,300 Australians and is currently the fastest-growing chronic disease amongst Australian children. Approximately 1,825 Australians are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes every year, and the disease occurs more frequently than cancer, cystic fibrosis, multiple sclerosis and muscular dystrophy. I come into contact with many in my local community who have diabetes or support someone living with diabetes and this is one small way that I can show my support for all of these people not just in Hasluck but across the country. </span>

Any opportunity to raise awareness whilst also raising some much needed funds for research should be embraced and celebrated. I will be taking steps at the Perth Walk to Cure Diabetes on Sunday 26 October at Burswood Park. With over 30 locations around Australia, I encourage members of this House to sign up to join me and Team Hasluck on the day by joining the team, forming their own team for a walk in their local area or donating by searching for my name on the JDRF website. I challenge the member for Perth to join me on that Sunday and walk with me.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hotham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  The government was caught out yesterday by using another enormous furphy to justify this unfair and inequitable budget they are trying to force through this parliament. Over the last few months we have heard so much hyperbole from those on the other side of the House about health care spending and how one of the biggest issues facing this country is the spiralling cost of health care. These guys never let the facts get in the way of a good story. We learned last night from the government's own Australian Institute of Health and Welfare that growth in health spending is at the lowest level it has been in decades.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">My conversations with doctors go to the heart of what is at stake here. We have people coming into this chamber and talking about this ridiculous fallacy that there are Australians all over the country who are going to the doctor for no reason—simply because they have nothing better to do. My conversations with doctors suggest anything but. We on this side of the House think that anything that helps Australians focus more on their primary healthcare needs is going to benefit the primary healthcare system in this country. We have had a number of constituents come into my office telling us that they are going to have to stop seeing the doctor because of the Medicare copayment, and we have heard through constituents that doctors are advising their patients that they will now have to front up to the ED when they need health care but cannot afford to go to the doctor. These changes are profoundly unfair and Labor will continue to oppose them.</span>

The local area of Barton has a strong connection with those of a Chinese background. Approximately 18,000 residents of Chinese ancestry live in my electorate, contributing to the fields of business, manufacturing and trade. I am proud to have been mayor when Nanxiong City became a partner with the City of Kogarah in 2010, as well as the significant moment in 2012 when Kogarah signed a memorandum of understanding with Nanxiong City. I was also privileged to be present within China in 2010 when we officially entered into our partnership. I hope to carry our relationship forward with me now as the member for Barton so that our national ties can be strengthened as well as our local ties.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The delegates officially presented me, and Kogarah City councillors, with a book of 134 Cantonese surnames of people who participated in an ancient southward migration from Zhuji Lane within Nanxiong City. Many of those surnames are carried forward by Chinese residents in Barton today. These surnames represent a significant story of migration aimed at building a better life This is just one story, and point of origin, which those of Chinese ancestry in Barton share with those in China today, and it is these shared connections which bring us closer together as two partner cities. I am looking forward to the future of the relationship between Nanxiong City and Kogarah City, as well as the broader future of China and Australia in this Asian century. I appreciated the opportunity to reinforce this connection and I thank the delegates for their time with us and their Australian friends last week. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Throsby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):     It has been more than a year since the election, and the Nationals have comprehensively failed on regional health. The Nationals have recently published their 25 achievements after one year in government. I have had a look at this document, and regional health does not rate a mention. There is a good reason for that. They promised before the election, 'No cuts to health'. But they have cut hospital funding by over $50 billion dollars. That means people in regional hospitals all around the country will have even worse facilities and fewer doctors and nurses.    They promised to provide a full-time regional health minister. Instead, we got a somebody who is excluded from all the big decisions when it comes to health. They promised to increase the Medicare rebate for regional doctors—instead, they cut it by $5, then they froze it and then they washed their hands of it. They have been lying about the cost of Medicare ever since they set foot in this place. They have said the cost is going up but in fact it has been constant for over 10 years as a proportion of government outlays. They promised to look at making the safety net fairer for medicines. Instead they have put huge holes in the safety net. I have produced a document which I seek leave to table. It will remind the Nationals of their promises and hopefully they will come in here and vote in accordance with their conscience. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:50</span>):  My electorate of Braddon has more than its fair share of local sporting champions, but last night Devonport local Macey Stewart rose to a new level when she claimed gold in the individual time trial at the UCI Junior Road World Championships in Spain. At just 18 years of age, Macey is proving to be unstoppable after claiming her third junior world championship title in the last six weeks. The electorate could not be prouder. When Macey returns to Devonport I will be honoured to present her personally with a Local Sporting Champions grant. Last week I had the honour of presenting 18 other local sporting champions with their grants. This Australian government initiative is designed to provide financial assistance to young people aged 12 to 18 towards the cost of travel, accommodation, uniforms and equipment when competing or coaching at state, national or international competitions.</span>

I encourage young sports men and women to visit my website, brettwhitelymp.com.au, and apply for a Local Sporting Champions grant. It is inspiring when our young people dream of reaching for the stars—just ask Macey Stewart.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Durack</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:53</span>):  Cyberbullying affects many of us, particularly young people, who are more vulnerable. Cyberbullying is when someone is tormented through any form of technology. Research shows that one-in-five children aged eight to 17 experiences cyberbullying, which, of course, is very worrying for all of us in this place. Because of my concern, I organise workshops on this issue, and more than 500 students and teachers in Geraldton took part in the cybersafety workshops held last week, thanks to the good grace of my colleague the member for Forrest. The workshops addressed the risks associated with social media like Facebook and Twitter, the child's digital footprint, what it means to be groomed online, unwanted contact, mobile phone security weaknesses, and scams. Essentially, the children learnt to be smart, safe and responsible when using technology. Although the teachers were alarmed by what they learnt, they will now learn to be more vigilant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Continuing the safety theme, also last week, more than 50 people attended a community crime forum in Geraldton that the local police, the local council and I hosted. Crime is a hot topic in Geraldton and the forum served to get the issues on the table: improve communication across agencies; raise concerns with the loss of funding for successful programs; and promote measures that address local crime, such as the newly formed burglary and youth focus squads. It would come as no surprise to learn that the lack of basics such as food, clothing, shelter et cetera were considered causal factors of crime and unsociable behaviour. I urge sustainable funding for youth programs to help address the root causes. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Urgency care departments are staffed by doctors who bulk-bill patients who present. They do not receive state funding so they are directly in the firing line when it comes to this government's GP tax. This means that every time a patient presents, the urgency care departments will have to ask for the $7. If you turn up with your son or daughter who may have a major gash or if you turn up with your son or daughter who has fallen out of a tree, before the doctor can treat them, you have to hand over $7.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is directly impacting urgency care departments by proposing this GP tax. What is it that it has against the bush and against small towns? Every single small urgency care department in regional Victoria—and I have three in my electorate—are now at risk. Doctors in Kyneton, doctors in Castlemaine and doctors in Heathcote are saying they do not think that, under this government's proposal, it is workable to keep these urgency care departments going. It is time this government started to listen to the doctors in the bush and stopped listening to the bean counters. It is time this government started to listen to people who are directly involved in these services.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  Educational opportunity unites all Australians. We have a shared hope and desire for our children and the generations thereafter. Education enables us to develop our full potential, have the widest possible choices for our future and contribute fully to our community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Wednesday, I represented the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Senator the Hon. Scott Ryan, to officially open the refurbished science classrooms at Oakleigh Grammar in my electorate of Higgins. Oakleigh Grammar is a tribute to the faith, vision and love of its founders and supporting community. Oakleigh Grammar's Greek heritage lives on today and was most apparent at the celebrations last week attended by many dignitaries of the Greek Community and the Greek Orthodox Church.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The refurbished physics, chemistry and biology facilities at Oakleigh Grammar show exactly what can be achieved by a school with strong leadership and a clear vision for the future as provided by the Principal, Mr Mark Robertson, and his team. The Australian government provided $623,000 for the refurbishment through its Capital Grants Program. The school community worked together to raise the remaining $257,856 to complete the project, led by their Management Committee President, Mr Angelo Sardellis. It is wonderful to see a school community celebrate with such pride and enthusiasm its refurbished science facilities. I congratulate Oakleigh Grammar and its community for this wonderful achievement.</span>

The GMML has been improving primary health care throughout the region with its community-driven, quality healthcare service since 2012. The GMML has been able to identify gaps in primary healthcare services in the region and has successfully redirected professionals into areas of need. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Towns struggling to attract health professionals now have visiting services. Esperance now has a paediatrician endocrinologist to treat children with type 1 diabetes; podiatry services are now being delivered to the Ngaanyatjarra Lands; physiotherapy services are being delivered in Leonora, Laverton and Exmouth; and a Hep C nurse is working alongside the physician in Geraldton—to name a few. Another significant change has been the introduction of a shared electronic record system, which has provided improved communication channels between hospitals and GPs. The community is devastated to know that all this great work will be dismantled by June 2015. Already, staff are leaving and services are being diminished. Medicare Locals have been a brilliant innovation for the delivery of primary health care in regional and remote communities but will be another victim of the Abbott government's destructive agenda. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Today the Institute of Health and Welfare has found that health expenditure in 2012-13 grew at its lowest rate in 30 years. Further, today the AMA president has said that this research 'makes a mockery of the government's claims that healthcare spending is out of control'. Does the Prime Minister agree with the AMA and will he now dump his unfair and unnecessary GP tax?</span>

Medicare expenditure is projected to grow at 6.1 per cent a year over the next decade. Ten years ago, we were spending $8 billion a year on Medicare; today, we are spending $20 billion a year on Medicare. That is why it is important to take action and to take action now to make Medicare sustainable for the long term, and that is exactly what this government has done. </span>

The meeting in question has been convened by President Obama, who estimates that there are now some 15,000 foreign fighters operating with terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I have previously told the House, there are at least 60 Australians that we know of who are currently fighting with terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq such as ISIL. There are at least 100 Australians that we know of who are supporting terrorist groups such as ISIL. More than 20 Australians are estimated to have already returned from fighting with groups such as ISIL and more than 60 Australians have had their passports cancelled, on security advice, to prevent them from travelling to the Middle East to join terrorist groups such as ISIL.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make it absolutely crystal clear, again, that fighting with a terrorist group is a serious crime under Australian law. The point I make to people is that, if you fight with a terrorist group and if you seek to return to this country, as far as this government is concerned you will be arrested, you will be prosecuted and you will be jailed for a very long time indeed. Legislation is before this parliament this week to make it easier to deal with this problem of returning foreign fighters. Again, I want to thank the Leader of the Opposition and I thank the shadow Attorney-General for their constructive support and broad bipartisanship on this particular issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a global problem. There are many hundreds of British citizens fighting with terrorist groups in the Middle East. There are hundreds of French citizens. There are hundreds and hundreds of people from south-east Asia who are fighting with these terrorist groups in the Middle East. These are people who have been radicalised and brutalised and could become potential terrorists in their home countries. This problem needs to be tackled both here and abroad, and that is why Australia stands ready to join an international coalition to disrupt and degrade ISIL's operations inside Iraq to remove this magnet for potential terrorists from around the world. I stress, as always, this government will do whatever we humanly can to keep Australians safe. Everything we do at home and abroad is directed against terrorism not religion, and I urge Australians to go about their normal lives because the whole point of terrorism is to prevent us from being ourselves.</span>

I think it is important that all of the comments of the president of the AMA should be made available to this House. The AMA is prepared, in principle, to support a co-payment, as the president made clear in discussions with me some time ago. This government supports a modest co-payment for Medicare, as members opposite did in the days when they were better led than they are now, when they were led by a reforming prime minister. Again, I make the point—as I make all the time in response to questions from the shadow minister—if it is right and proper to have a modest co-payment on the PBS, how can it not also be right and proper to have a modest co-payment on Medicare?</span>

As the Prime Minister has already noted, the priority of this government is the safety and security of all Australians. We are now aware of up to 160 of our citizens who are either fighting or supporting the conflicts in Iraq and Syria. To do this, terrorist groups need both material and financial support. They need this to carry out their barbarous acts—the sort of things we have seen recently. Supporting them is a serious crime under Australian law and is punishable by life imprisonment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Abbott government is determined to detect and disrupt terrorism financing in Australia and to take action against people who support terrorists. As the Prime Minister announced on 11 September as part of the government's $630 million counter-terrorism package, $20 million has been provided to AUSTRAC for a dedicated national security team. AUSTRAC is the agency responsible for counter-terrorism financing, and this new commitment will provide additional analysts and new intelligence systems which will significantly enhance their ability to do that. AUSTRAC will work with other national security and law enforcement agencies to prevent financial support flowing to those Australians who are fighting overseas, to identify opportunities to disrupt and stop terrorist acts and to monitor financial activity in relation to foreign conflicts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">AUSTRAC has recently provided the government with a report into terrorism financing and its assessment is that the conflicts in Syria and Iraq currently pose the most significant terrorism financing risks to our country. Some perpetrators attempt to disguise funds collected for terrorist groups by concealing them with legitimate business or fundraising activities, and this is why we need to give the experts all the resources they need to do this job. We saw last week the important work of AUSTRAC when it suspended the registration of Bisotel Rieh, a Sydney based remitter service. This company had failed to declare $9 million of transfers between January and August of this year. AUSTRAC has also commenced proceedings to cancel Bisotel Rieh's registration due to the risk that that company may be involved in or utilised for terrorism financing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyone who supports terrorists is playing a direct role in their atrocious actions and they are endangering Australian lives. This government will continue to make the necessary investments to stop this happening and will continue to keep all Australians safe and secure.</span>

                  </a>  And yes, in that year Labor did spend $70 million less on health than in the year before, despite the fact that they were out telling Australians that they were spending more and more on health each year. Yes, it is the case that they spent less in that year. But let me just go to the reasons that was the case: $70 million less in that year, but people will remember when the Labor Party brought in a policy that resulted in millions of Australians prepaying their private health insurance premiums to beat the tax Labor was imposing on Australians with private health insurance. What that did was drag expenditure from one year into the next. Labor does not go into the detail, and Labor is never good with numbers.</span>

                  </a>  In this budget the government committed to spending about $65 billion on health this year, which grew each and every year over the course of the next four years to about $74 billion by year 4. As a country we spend about $140 billion per year on health, and that continues to grow as our population ages and as new medical technologies need to be adopted. We are spending more and more and more on health; that is absolutely the case. But it needs to be at a sustainable pace.</span>

So, whilst we grow health expenditure each and every year in this budget, we do not do it at the same rate—the same unsustainable rate—that Labor was proposing. In the health budget we will spend about $20 billion this year—</span>

Why does the government seek to shrink the money supply and domestic demand when our debt level is only 12 per cent of GDP and the average OECD country's debt level is 73 per cent of GDP and Australia has a AAA credit rating?</span>

If I remember correctly, I think Australia's debt level actually peaked at about World War II, associated with the costs associated with war. From that period on, debt levels started to reduce. And Menzies was a great Prime Minister, because he reduced the debt levels, just as this Prime Minister wants to reduce the debt levels and just as the Howard government reduced the debt levels, because that is what Liberals do: we pay off the debt that Labor builds up—</span>

                  </a>  As the member for Fairfax knows, you never want to end up in an economic trough. You do not want to end up in a trough, because when you end up in a trough you get yourself into trouble. And of course if you keep spending money that you do not have—or other people's money, which is even worse—you can end up in the trough. From our perspective, we want Australia to be strong and robust. We want Australians to be prosperous, and the best way to do that is for Australia to live within its means. And the second thing you should do is understand that we cannot continue to put expenditure on the credit card. We cannot continue to build up deficit and debt that we cannot afford to repay over a long period of time. That is why we have made the tough decisions, the difficult decisions, but the right decisions in the budget.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we implement these measures across our airports, our Customs and Border Protection Service have calibrated their settings at a very high level for obvious reasons. As we introduce these new measures we ask the travelling public for tolerance, patience, understanding and sensitivity for the serious matters the officers are having to deal with. Our officers will always act in good faith and with professionalism. They will do so in accordance with the law and they will treat everyone with dignity and respect, including respect for cultural sensitivities. Our officers will screen all inbound and outbound passengers, as they always have, and they will use a range of indicators to determine which of those travellers they intend to speak to and ask further information from. This is also informed by our partnering with other law enforcement agencies and security agencies at both state and federal levels to inform this process.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government recognises, of course, as does the service, the importance of religious events such as the upcoming Hajj and the legitimacy of travel that relates to people going to attend the Hajj. The service is consulting with relevant community groups. I can inform the House about our practices, and today the deputy CEO of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service met with the Grand Mufti and the National Imams Council in Sydney to discuss these very issues. That process will be ongoing and in other states and territories, and it is supported by the 10 ethnic liaison officers who are in my own department and who have been engaged tin similar activities. We are committed to those ongoing consultations. Additional information regarding travel to the Hajj in October is being placed on the Customs 'Know before you go' website. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The key messages are these: to turn up early; to declare any cash; and to understand the rules of prohibited items which will be set out on that website. The government would regret any inconvenience or potential embarrassment that may be caused by our officer having to go about the sensitive tasks they have to do, but we know they are doing the job we have tasked them to do to protect Australia and all Australians. They deserve our respect and courtesy for the job they are doing, and they will act with the same courtesy and respect to all those they come in contact with as they undertake their responsibilities.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">The Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:28</span>):  I thank the honourable member for Higgins for her question and recognise that she has had a lot of experience and involvement in Treasury over the years. The fact is that in the modern taxation system and the modern digital world it is unfortunately easy for some companies to establish their taxable income liability in other jurisdictions, particularly smaller jurisdictions. Because of the mobility of capital, even if Australia took action by itself we would not be able to prevent major corporations minimising their tax liability in Australia. So we have a multipronged attack. The starting point, arising out of the G20, is it is hugely important that the globe, including a number of small islands which have been known as tax havens over a long period of time, takes action. There is a deep resolve within the G20 under the presidency of Australia to reformat the global taxation system. The Commissioner of Taxation said in a press conference on Saturday morning that as a result of what we have done at the G20:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This is resetting the tax rules, the way that countries operate over the next 50 - 100 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, as we know, the modern taxation laws were first developed after World War I by the League of Nations. There has not been any reformatting of global tax rules for a long period of time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has a multipronged approach. Firstly, we will implement whatever measures we can domestically to ensure that companies that are earn profits here pay tax here. That is hugely important as a starting principle. Secondly, we want to ensure that wherever people open bank accounts information is shared with the Australian Taxation Office. So if they open bank accounts in other countries around the world there is a common reporting standard to be applied. For Australian financial institutions—even though the big banks are able to move now, smaller banks, smaller players, are unable to move—from 1 January 2017 that will apply here. Thirdly, we are focusing on a 15-point base erosion plan delivered by the OECD. The final point is that we are implementing a tax inspectors without borders policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I would just quote the head of the OECD, Angel Gurria. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Had it not been for the very serious political support that we have gotten from the G20 presidency of Australia, really, we would not have gotten here.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fundamental point is that we want to catch the tax cheats and we are going to do everything we can to get them.</span>

The fact is that the government has an economic action strategy that is getting on with the job of helping to build a stronger and more prosperous economy with more and better paid jobs. Importantly, we are ensuring that we can maintain and improve our quality of life over time.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some good signs. There are of course bits of conflicting news from time to time but there are some good signs. As CommSec chief economist Craig James said in an article entitled 'Consumers are back in the groove' this morning, 'Aussie consumers are getting on with life'. That is right; they are getting on with it. Australian consumers are starting to pick up. That is coming about because they are starting to get more confidence about the way the economy is heading. They know that we have an economic action strategy to start to address the legacy of deficit left behind by Labor, which simply increased debt. If we were not to take any action the debt of the federal government would increase to $667 billion in 10 years time.</span>

He was damn right; the Labor Party left the budget in a ruinous state. But I tell you what: the coalition is ready to fix it. If we do not fix the mess that Labor left, Australians are going to be left with a lesser quality of life—and the coalition would never leave Australia like that.</span>

Why does this Prime Minister want to take Australia down the path of American universities, where degrees cost $100,000 or more?</span>

The first is that no student need pay a dollar up-front. The second is that FEE-HELP remains, and must remain, to ensure that people can cover their fees. The third is that the Commonwealth taxpayer will continue to cover 50 per cent of people's university education. This is a perfectly good system and it will get stronger under this government. What will happen under this government is that our universities will be liberated to be the best they possibly can be. We want our universities to be able to compete with the best in the world. We do not want our universities to be stagnating—as would have inevitably been the case had we persisted with Labor's system.</span>

I also thank other Tasmanian members for continuing to draw my attention to the vital importance for a state like Tasmania of having competitive shipping rates. Simple geography demands that for Tasmania to be competitive it has to have shipping rates that are comparable with freight rates in other parts of the country. Shipping plays a vital part in Australia's economy. Around 99.5 per cent of Australia's trade is carried by ship.</span>

                  </a>  So it is absolutely essential that we have competitive shipping rates in this country. I know that Tasmanian shippers are struggling with increased costs. As an example, Bell Bay Aluminium in the member for Bass's electorate has reported a massive 63 per cent increase in freight rates from Queensland following the first year of Labor's so-called shipping reforms—one year of Labor's shipping reforms leading to a 63 per cent increase in freight rates! At the same time as this increase from $18.20 a tonne to $29.70 a tonne in just one year was occurring, the rate for international vessels on that same route was $17.50. In that same year, demurrage costs more than doubled from $14,000 to $35,000. This has taken $4 million of the bottom line of Bell Bay Aluminium, a company that employs 400 Tasmanians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not just that industry. Many are bearing the burden of extra shipping costs as a result of Labor's shipping changes. It is especially the case for primary industries in Tasmania but it is true for other parts of the country as well. Labor's shipping reforms were supposed to revitalise Australia's shipping industry, but in fact they were just a sop to Labor's trade union masters in the MUA. Labor's plan has not saved a single job in Australian shipping, but it has cost hundreds of jobs onshore. The reality is that these so-called shipping reforms have been a catastrophe for the Australian shipping industry. In the two years of their operation, the deadweight capacity of Australian flagged ships has fallen by 64 per cent. Two-thirds of our shipping capacity has been lost in just two years under Labor's so-called shipping reforms. The industry is at a crucial point. We need reform. We need to make changes to the shipping industry so that it can survive and underpin a strong Australian economy.</span>

Before the election the Prime Minister promised to ensure the continuation of the current arrangements for university funding, but it has been revealed today that, because of the Prime Minister's unfair changes to universities, fees for economics students at the University of Western Australia will increase by 56 per cent from 2016. Now that the Prime Minister's promise has been exposed as a sham, will the Prime Minister finally abandon his unfair university changes?</span>

Firstly, they will spread the opportunity to get a higher education qualification to 80,000 more young Australians, with all the private benefit that that will bring in higher income, low unemployment, longer life expectancy, better health outcomes and higher incomes. Secondly, these reforms will free universities to be able to compete internationally and to raise the revenue they need to continue to be amongst the best universities and the best university system in the world.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These reforms are vital in bringing able to bring about those two incomes. All we are asking students to do for all the benefits that they receive is to pay 50 per cent of the cost of their education. They are currently paying 40 per cent. We are asking them to pay 50 per cent and we are asking the taxpayers to continue to pay half the cost for those university students to gain those extraordinary benefits. Under our very fair system, students can borrow every single dollar of that up-front and pay it back at the lowest interest rates they will ever get for a loan in their lives. They do not have to start paying it back until they earn over $50,000 a year.</span>

They have demonstrated that they will be charging $16,000 a year for a university in the top 100 in the world. There are 11,500 universities in the world. They are a top 100 university and they are going to charge $16,000 a year. That is light-years away from the $34,000 a year that Labor is trying to scare students with. We are moving in the right direction and we are making great progress with our reforms. These reforms will save universities and give students the chance for more opportunities.</span>

She actually cares about the environment, unlike our friends over here who have not bothered to ask one question in a single year amongst the entire lot of them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Corangamite is also a great friend of constituents and she voted to repeal the carbon tax, to reduce the cost of electricity and to deliver savings to her constituents. Despite what those opposite said, the savings to constituents are not just flowing, they have been backdated to 1 July 2014. What do we see for Victorian consumers? For customers of AGL Energy, we see an 8.9 per cent electricity saving; for customers of Powerdirect, a 12.4 per cent electricity saving. For small business customers in Australia with AGL, we see a 9.7 per cent electricity saving; with Simply Energy, a 10 per cent saving; and with Lumo Energy, a 10.7 per cent saving. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The thing to remember is those opposite said these price savings would never flow back to consumers. It is not just electricity; it is also gas. Remember we said that on average there would be a seven per cent saving to consumers. In Victoria, for residential AGL customers there has been a 7.2 per cent saving. For Origin Energy customers, there has been a 7.5 per cent saving; and for Simply Energy customers, an eight per cent saving. If you are a small business user of gas, savings start at 10 per cent with Simply Energy, go to 10.3 per cent with AGL Energy and rise to 10.5 per cent with Origin Energy. These are the real savings going to consumers in small business and in residential situations right now, but these are the savings which those opposite want to take away. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whether it is the member for Grayndler or whether it is the Leader of the Opposition, their plan is a very simple plan—that is, to return the carbon tax. They voted to keep it; we voted to repeal it. The reality is that electricity prices for Victorian consumers are coming down; gas prices for Victorian consumers are coming down. Every day that they sit there, they are preparing to vote the carbon tax back if they regain government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There will be a very simple choice for the electors of Corangamite: a carbon tax with an 8.9 per cent increase for AGL Energy customers and a 12 per cent increase for Powerdirect customers under the Labor Party, or a reduction of those amounts under the coalition.</span>

                  </a>  What we are doing is a major microeconomic reform that will protect our international education export industry, which is worth $15 billion a year. Admittedly, it was $19 billion a year under the Howard government, and Labor managed to shrink it to $15 billion. I see you have gone very quiet again. So you cut higher education spending by $6.6 billion, you shrunk our international export industry in education to $15 billion, which we are now rebuilding, and you have run a scare campaign in the last few months about nonsensical $100,000 degrees, which has been exploded by the University of Western Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we are doing is a major deregulation of higher education which will free our universities to be the best education system in the world with some of the best universities in the world. It will give more students the opportunity to get a higher education qualification and go on to earn 75 per cent more over a lifetime than the more than 60 per cent of Australians who do not have a higher education degree. Do not just take my word for it, Member for Kingston. You have asked more questions than the member for Adelaide ever did on education. You have given me the opportunity—and I am grateful for it—to say that one member of this House very sensibly wrote: </span>

                  </a>  Who said that? It is not the absent shadow Assistant Treasurer; it is the now shadow Treasurer. No wonder he has been so quiet. No wonder the member for McMahon is so quiet, because he, along with Bob Hawke, Paul Keating and the shadow Assistant Treasurer all know about the inherent logic of the government's deregulation of the higher education system. I suspect that even the Leader of the Opposition understands the inherent logic of deregulation but cannot control Kim Carr and the left in his own party. I suspect that if he was in government, he would be moving in a very similar direction. I ask the Labor Party to join Universities Australia, the Regional Universities Network, the Australian Technical Network of Universities and all the universities across Australia that have united to call on this Senate to pass this reform. Get into the national conversation, Labor. Let's bring about some reform in this country. Do not just stand in the way.</span>

The member for Mallee, with an electorate of about 74,000 square kilometres, is very aware of the agricultural sector. One of the great things that this side of the House has brought for the member for Mallee was the Wimmera-Mallee pipeline, one of the biggest engineering projects in delivery of water, and it was brought about by this side of the House. That is what we gave the people of Mallee.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What did the Labor Party give them? The Labor Party gave them a $100,000 carbon tax bill to operate it. That is basically what they gave them from that. Then we went on to the Sunraysia Modernisation Project, another massive infrastructure project for Mallee. What did the Labor Party give them? They gave them the carbon tax bill for the operation of the pumps. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a clear understanding of the difference between the two sides. The Labor Party gave Murray-Goulburn a $14 million a year tax bill to process the milk including between $1,300 and $7,000 a year per dairy shed. That is what the Labor Party gave them. What did we give them? We gave them the record high price for dairy product on 30 June this year. </span>

But I am sure that it was just another general attack. Let me reassure the Leader of the Opposition that this government made a series of commitments to the Australian people prior to the election that we would scrap the carbon tax, that we would stop the boats, that we would build the roads and we would get the budget back under control, and that is exactly what we are doing. I know members opposite cannot understand the idea of a government actually keeping its commitments. I know that members opposite cannot understand the idea of a government which takes fiscal responsibility seriously. But we do.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr TURNBULL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Communications</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:06</span>):  I thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge his considerable expertise in the area of financial management. There are four big taxpayer owned businesses in my portfolio: the NBN Co, Australia Post, the ABC and the Special Broadcasting Service, all of which are facing very big management challenges. The NBN Co, of course, we have discussed at great length during question time, and the incompetence of the Conrovian era interrupted for a brief time by the member for Grayndler as communications minister—a whole panoply of incompetence which we are now slowly and deliberately cleaning up with competent management. I would like to get an occasional question from the member for Blaxland, but he is only interested in yachting. He is a phantom. He is not just a shadow minister; he is a phantom shadow minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there are other big challenges that we are addressing too. Australia Post's letters business has been declining for a considerable time. Over the last five years, including during the entire period of the Labor government, Australia Post's letters business has been declining. Over the last five years alone it has declined by one billion letters. It is a high fixed cost business, and the consequence of this is that Australia Post has run up its first loss—as honourable members would have seen in the last six months. And over the next decade, if there is not significant reform made to Australia Post, the letters business alone will lose $12 billion and the company as a whole will lose cumulatively $6.6 billion. This trend was very clear under Labor, but absolutely nothing was done. They just kicked the can down the road and we are now doing the work, doing the hard yards, working closely with management to ensure that we can put Australia Post on a sustainable footing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning to the national broadcasters: the ABC for years has not been under any pressure or any incentive from government to run its business efficiently. It does not have the natural pressures of a commercial broadcaster. We have put in a thorough efficiency review conducted by my department and assisted by Peter Lewis, former CFO of the Seven Network, and we have identified very substantial savings that can be made from back office and administrative waste at the public broadcasters. All of this is a reminder of the fundamental point that whatever you may think about the Labor Party—you might like their policies—the one thing that they cannot do is manage. They cannot manage anything.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWA" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms RISHWORTH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingston</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:12</span>):  I rise today to condemn this government's unfair budget, which attacks both current and future Australian university students, condemning them to a debt sentence. This government's proposed changes to Australia's higher education sector is an ideological frolic from this Minister for Education to ensure that only those who can afford to attain a higher education can get one. Allowing universities to charge students whatever fees they like will take Australia down a path of American universities, where degrees cost students $100,000 or more. Going to university should depend on your ability, hard work and qualifications and not on your parents' bank account. Education is absolutely essential for Australia's opportunities and our economic growth and future. Higher university fees will put this at risk. Let me be clear, this government's higher education proposal is nothing more than a collection of broken promises—not just broken promises made before the election but broken promises made after the election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take the House through some of these broken promises that those opposite made during the lead-up to last year's election. First, we have the coalition's 'real solutions' pamphlet. Many of those on the other side should remember it—they held it up enough times. But they obviously forgot to read it because what it said is:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We will ensure the continuation of current arrangements of university funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has since slashed $5.8 billion from the higher education sector—a clear broken promise of their election commitment. Of course, we cannot forget the Prime Minister's pledge on election eve: no cuts to education. He promised the Australian people this. I am not sure what a $5.8 billion cut means to the Prime Minister, but it certainly looks like a broken promise to me. Then, of course, there is the famous media release published on pyneonline, the minister's website, saying the coalition will not cap places or raise HECS. This is yet another broken promise as the deregulation of fees and the compounding interest on HECS and HELP student loans will increase the average student debt by tens of thousands of dollars. No matter what the minister tries to spin, and no matter what the minister tries to say, the evidence is in. University fees are going up and they are going up not by a small amount but by a large amount.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even after the election people were fed blatant mistruths by the government. The minister went on television on 17 November. It is a very interesting read if anyone would like to read that—it is still on Pyne Online. He said on Sky News a number of things. First, when he was asked about raising university fees, he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… we promised that we wouldn't and Tony Abbott made it very clear before the election that we would keep our promises.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, I certainly recommend the 17 November interview to anyone who has not read it because he also stated very clearly, absolutely categorically, that they were not going to raise fees. The deregulation of uni fees and the introduction of $100,000 degrees is another broken promise. Then there was this pearler by the minister:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The days when governments get elected or political parties get elected and then junk their policies and promises, I'm hoping it's over for good. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course he forgot that interview. He forgot the assurances he made. He just kept lying to the Australian people. He also said in the same interview:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the public want a period of stable government where … the government keeps its promises … And there's much I can do in universities and schools while keeping all my promises …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why then is the minister not doing a whole lot in universities and not doing a whole lot in schools except breaking his promises?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the government would like to pretend that they are not breaking their commitments and that they are not cutting $5.8 billion out of higher education, this is real. We know that allowing universities to charge what they want will lead to $100,000 degrees. The minister can say all he likes that this is not true, but that is not what the independent modelling has shown. Indeed, the National Tertiary Education Union's modelling has revealed that universities will lose more than $4.7 billion, the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling has revealed that degrees are likely to double or triple in cost and the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research has revealed that lifelong debt and loan defaults will be a reality under the government's changes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister likes to paint these figures as alarmist propaganda put up by the Labor Party and say that all we are doing is running a fear campaign, but they have been confirmed today. The minister said clearly in question time that the government was not increasing fees. I would like to see him answer the question properly because we saw today that the University of Western Australia is introducing a 30 per cent increase in student fees. So while the minister has been in this House today saying that there will be no increase in fees we have seen on the ground today the announcement of a significant increase in fees. That is the reality. This is not based on research and modelling—and I think that modelling has been very credible—this is real.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear the minister often saying that $100,000 degrees are not real. If he looked at the details and took time to look at the announcement today, he would see that someone who wants to be a lawyer and go to the University of Western Australia will have $95,000 of debt and students undertaking medicine will be forced to shoulder well over $100,000 worth of debt. This minister is condemning Australian students to a debt sentence well in excess of $100,000. The Americanisation of Australian universities with $100,000 degrees will shut the door on young people.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we have the really important aspect that the minister was bragging about today—that is, indexation of student debt. The proposed changes will lead to indexation of student debt, a compounding rate of student debt. Many on the other side promised that they would lobby the minister and the Prime Minister on this. Unfortunately, their lobbying fell on deaf ears because in the proposal we will see the bond rate applied. This will have a significant impact on so many people.</span>

I am going to make sure that we do not have real interest rates.' Unfortunately, the member for Bass failed to be heard in his own caucus. What we are talking about is compounding interest not just for new students but for anyone with a HECS debt. In New South Wales over 340,000 Australians with an existing loan will be forced to pay extra. In South Australia 85,000 people with pre-existing student debt will be forced to pay real compounding interest. Queensland members will be asking 345,000 of their constituents to pay more.</span>

They will pay more interest on it. It is surprising that we are getting the Treasurer and the Minister for Education beating their chests about how important this is because they indeed protested against any increase in any fees back in their university days. I distinctly remember the Treasurer saying that $250 was a lot of money for students and they should not have to pay that. How times have changed. Now the Treasurer is asking students not to blink an eye at $100,000.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FLETCHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:22</span>):  I am very pleased to rise to speak on this matter of public importance, which attacks the Abbott government's reform package for higher education. And, as is typical of this opposition, it is strong on complaint but there is no plan of its own. By contrast, the Abbott government does have a plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fundamental problem with this MPI is threefold: firstly, the government's higher education reforms strengthen the system and create more opportunities for students; secondly, this package is consistent with core principles of fairness—that is, if you get substantial private value from a university degree, you should bear a fair share of the cost of providing that degree; and, thirdly, this MPI makes no mention of the key equity safeguards that are built into the package but that are ignored in Labor's dishonest scare campaign.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These reforms strengthen the system and create more opportunities for students. Thanks to these reforms, there will be an additional 80,000 Commonwealth supported places by 2018, there will be 35,000 bachelor degree places and there will be 48,000 places for diploma, advanced diploma and associate degree students. There is an expansion of funding beyond the current players in the system to any registered higher education institution, including TAFES, private colleges and universities. These reforms allow a stronger university system in Australia; they allow Australian universities to maintain and, over time, improve their global ratings, which of course serve the interests of Australian students and gives more of them a globally recognised credential.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But do not just take my word for it. What is it that the Vice-Chancellor of the Australian Catholic University, Professor Greg Craven, had to say? He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There are three good reasons … universities must be able to set their own fees …otherwise we cannot fund vital national research; the international perception of Australian higher education will decline; and students will get an education that is admittedly cheap but increasingly nasty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the things that Professor Greg Craven says will happen if this Abbott government reform package does not go through.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Sandra Harding, of James Cook University, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We shouldn't underestimate the size of these reforms or the need or urgency for these reforms. The status quo is not an option.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These reforms maintain and continue the reform direction laid down by the Bradley review of higher education in 2008. That review recommended opening up universities to everybody with the desire and the requisite ability to attend. The previous Labor government did half the job: they deregulated the number of places, but they rejected the Bradley recommendation that base funding per student going into the system should increase. And so we have an outcome where the number of places has increased, but at the same time the previous Labor government cut funding. And isn't this an absolutely classic Labor approach: great rhetoric, worthy goals, but no performance, no delivery, no plan as to how to make these outcomes actually materialise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Belinda Robinson, of Universities Australia, said yesterday in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Financial Review</span>:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is simply not possible to maintain the standards that students expect or the international reputation that Australia's university system enjoys without full fee deregulation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the reforms contained in the package that the Abbott government is putting forward, which education minister, Christopher Pyne, is leading, are reforms designed to strengthen the university system and, in turn, create more opportunities for Australian students.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second point that goes to the fallacy of this MPI is that the policy approach the Abbott government is pursuing is consistent with a core principle of fairness—that is, if you get substantial private value from a university degree, it is only fair that you bear some of the cost. Again, do not just take my word for it. Former Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating in 1995 said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There is no such thing of course as free education—somebody has to pay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Or the current shadow Treasurer, in his widely read 2013 book <span style="font-style:italic;">Hearts and Minds</span>, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Hawke Government also introduced the Higher Education Contribution Scheme as a way of raising more revenue to finance the extension of the number of university places … I supported it because I could see the inherent logic: our incomes would be higher because we had been to university.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Or, indeed, former Prime Minister Bob Hawke, interviewed in 1998 for <span style="font-style:italic;">Collective </span><span style="font-style:italic;">wisdom</span>, said about HECS:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I don't have any problem with the concept of fees … one of the greatest stupidities was the proposition that the Whitlam Labor government introduced of "free" education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Or, of course, there is the man whose thoughts we turn to so often in this chamber, the shadow Assistant Treasurer, Andrew Leigh, who had this to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… government alone cannot provide all of the additional funding necessary for our universities to become top notch. More money is required from all sources, including students.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is consistent with these basic principles of fairness, articulated by a series of Labor thinkers who I have quoted in this debate today, which underpins the logic of the approach the Abbott government is taking in its reforms in higher education to shift the proportion of the cost of a university degree, which is met by the student taking the degree from today's 40 per cent on average to 50 per cent on average.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The third point I want to make in the time available today is that we have had a disgraceful scare campaign, a dishonest scare campaign from the Labor Party about the likely outcomes in the education market place as universities go about setting their fees once they are given the freedom to do so. It is a disgraceful scare campaign, which ignores many of the facts and the opinions of key participants in the sector. What did the Vice Chancellor of La Trobe University have to say in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review </span>on 15 September? He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… if given the freedom, universities can be trusted to be sensible on how they will price courses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He added:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The best way to ensure moderate fee increases is to not set a ceiling on prices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, much of the overblown commentary—the dire threats of the kind of fee level we might expect—seems to ignore the operation of a competitive market and the fact that Australian universities will be subject to competitive disciplines. It will not be feasible for them to set prices which are higher than students will be willing to pay and higher than their competitors charge. And, of course, it is not just domestic competitors but international competitors, online competitors and so on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the other disgraceful misrepresentations which are commonly made in this debate by the Labor Party is that there is going to be in some way a removal of the HECS scheme. In fact, on the contrary, there will continue to be no up-front fees. Students will continue to have available to them the HECS scheme—now known as HELP—under which, rather than being required to pay up-front, they can accumulate a debt and pay that over time, and it is income contingent. You are not required to pay a dollar until such time as you reach the threshold, which is presently slightly over $50,000 a year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we also fail to hear about from the Labor Party are all of the other equity measures contained in this comprehensive package. There are measures for low-income students—those from a disadvantaged background. There is the proposed new Commonwealth scholarships scheme, which will benefit thousands of students from a disadvantaged background. Indeed, universities will be required to spend one dollar in five of additional revenue on scholarships for disadvantaged students. There are the elements to improve equity for regional students and regional campuses with a regional loading of $274 million over four years. The support is extended to private universities and non-university higher education providers, many of which have a very good record of getting non-traditional students into tertiary education. Again I quote Greg Craven, of the Australian Catholic University:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… Pyne has moved decisively to protect students entering lowly paid but socially vital professions.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is vital that there be reforms made to the higher education system to make it stronger and to give more opportunities for students. The coalition has a plan to do that. Labor has no plan; it just has the usual whingeing.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="193430" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WATTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gellibrand</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:32</span>):  Just under 30 years ago a member of this chamber took their first tentative steps into the political fray by nominating themselves as a first-year student for election to the august position of student representative of the University of Adelaide's education standing committee. It was a bashful start; the member in question could not manage to include a picture of themselves in their materials. That being said, they did provide an election statement—a formal statement of their raison d'etre for running for election. In their statement the bashful member said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I feel it my duty to stand for election and do everything possible to forestall the introduction of fees and indeed to end any movement by the federal government to introduce fees.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I happen to support the imposition of income-contingent, reasonable-deferred-repayment university fees for university students, but I do understand that 30 years ago many idealistic young Labor members opposed fees of this kind. The extraordinary thing is that this election statement was not made by a Labor MP. It was not the member for Adelaide. It was not the member for Kingston. It was not the member for Port Adelaide. Who could this be? It was the Minister for Education, Christopher Pyne.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How could this be? Did the education minister undergo an ideological epiphany from student socialist to high tory over the past 30 years, or is there another explanation? The education minister's comments in a recent interview with the ABC's Fran Kelly about another coalition MP's awkward history in student politics might be enlightening in this regard. Minister for Education Christopher Pyne's explanation for the disconnect between the historical comments and the government's current policy was:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">You don't get elected as student politician by saying the opposite to what the voters in your university are thinking.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fast forward 30 years, and this is exactly the contemptuous, cynical, deceptive approach that the minister is taking in his latest elected office. Before the last federal election, the coalition's Real Solutions policy pamphlet—another document that, surprisingly enough, is also missing the face of the education minister—made this promise to the Australian people:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We will ensure the continuation of the current arrangements of university funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The education minister made the meaning of this commitment crystal clear when he gave an interview on Sky News in November just last year after the election. Responding when asked whether he would like to raise university fees, he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I'm not even considering it because we promised that we wouldn't. Tony Abbott made it very clear before the election that we would keep our promises.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Six months later comes the federal budget, and Australians have found that the word of the federal education minister is worth just as little as the word of the student politician. A cut of $1.9 billion in Commonwealth funding for university places, a broken promise that will force universities to start raising fees—for Australian students this means hikes in the cost of their degrees of at least 30 per cent just to replace what the government's broken promise has taken out. It means engineering students will be paying up to 58 people cent more to make up for the cut. Nursing students will pay 24 per cent more for their nursing degrees. Our environmental studies students will have to pay 110 per cent more to study their courses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even more fundamentally, the deregulation of fees means that universities can charge whatever they would like for these degrees. If the market will bear over $100,000 for a law degree, as it is at the University of Melbourne, that is what students will pay. We saw in WA today that we are already seeing more $100,000 degrees. It is a shift in our higher education system towards the rich and away from the smart. It means our bright young students from disadvantaged families will learn that it is money, not merit that determines their future. It means our universities will cater for a narrow elite, not the egalitarian majority needed by the Australian economy and our society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this deception did not end with the budget. No, in the second reading speech of the higher education bills the education minister claimed, 'Students will benefit the most.' In an interview on the ABC's <span style="font-style:italic;">Insiders </span>program the education minister claimed, 'Students will always be the winners.' If students will always be the winners, why didn't you tell them before the election? Why keep it a secret? If it is so great, make it a vote winner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You have to go back to Victor Hugo to find out the education minister's animated political philosophy:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… he does not speak, he lies. This man lies as other men breathe. He announces an honest intention; be on your guard: he makes an assertion, distrust him: he takes an oath, tremble.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people did not vote for these changes at the last election and they do not want them. The Australian Labor Party will fight these changes every step of the way through this place. We will fight them every step of the way in our community and we will fight them all the way through the next election, when we kick this deceitful government out.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="M2Y" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TUDGE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Aston</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:37</span>):  Whatever happened to the Labor Party of Hawke and Keating? That is what I want to know, because the member for Gellibrand talks about what happened 30 years ago. I can tell you what happened 30 years ago: Australia elected the Hawke-Keating government. On this side of the House, we proudly say that it was a good government. It was perhaps the best Labor government that Labor has had—and that is not a particularly high standard. It introduced some significant reforms, including economic reforms, deregulation of the economy and the reintroduction of tariffs. But one of the most significant reforms that it introduced was the Higher Education Contribution Scheme, known as HECS. This great Hawke-Keating legacy was to introduce a scheme whereby the students themselves would contribute some money towards their higher education degrees, knowing that, by going to university themselves, they were likely to earn so much more money in the future. It just seemed sensible to the Hawke-Keating government that this was a good scheme to introduce and that students themselves should contribute.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In some respects, the reforms that we are introducing now are a logical extension of those Hawke-Keating reforms. They build on the HECS system which is in place. If you listened to Belinda Robinson, who is the head of Universities Australia, you would know that she herself says that these reforms are the logical evolution of higher education policy. What these reforms do, just like the Hawke HECS reforms, is open up opportunities for tens of thousands more students. We estimate that 80,000 more people will be able to access higher education as a result of the reforms that we are introducing, because, for the very first time, sub-degrees will be part of the HECS system. This means that an associate degree, or a diploma, will now not have to be paid for up-front but will be part of the HECS system. This is so good for people from families who have not previously attended higher education, because they can often use those qualifications as a pathway into a higher education degree. This is what we are talking about with these reforms. They will open up opportunities and create more scholarships than have ever been created in the history of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those scholarships will not just help with tuition fees but help with living expenses. At the end of the day, the biggest barrier to higher education is not your Higher Education Contribution Scheme fees—which are all deferred and do not have to be paid until you are earning above $50,000—but your living expenses. Rural students particularly know these barriers, as do low-SES students. The package that we are putting forward will put $1 out of every $5 of increase in HECS towards scholarships. Those scholarships will help underprivileged students access university, paying for their living costs so that they can get there, whereas otherwise they may not get there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do not know what happened to the Hawke-Keating era of the Labor Party. It seems to have been abandoned. While the member for Kingston raised this particular matter today, you suspect that the people who are actually driving higher education policy are Senator Kim 'il-Carr' over in the Senate, Senator Hanson-Young and perhaps Adam Bandt. It is the left of the party these days that dominates Labor's education policy. There are still a couple of sensible people on that side of the House. We have mentioned Chris Bowen. We have talked about his book, <span style="font-style:italic;">Hearts &amp; Minds</span>, as the member for Bradfield did. The shadow Treasurer himself supports the HECS system and supports such measures, as does, of course, the shadow Assistant Treasurer, who also supports deregulation of fees. He supports a market based HECS scheme to provide greater opportunities for all. But, sadly, you can be the shadow Treasurer, you can be the Assistant Treasurer and you can even be the leader and believe in these things, but no longer do you get to run higher education policy within the Labor Party, because that is run by the left. It is run by Kim 'il-Carr'; it is run by their Green coalition partners Senator Hanson-Young and Adam Bandt. They are the ones who are dominating Labor, who have abandoned the Hawke-Keating legacy. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Charlton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:43</span>):  What a pathetic effort—a pathetic effort to talk about the Hawke and Keating legacy. Over on this side of parliament, we are proud of the Hawke-Keating legacy, and we are the beneficiaries of it. We are the beneficiaries of going to university under an affordable HECS scheme—a HECS scheme that did not bog us down and drag us down with hundred-grand university fees. We are proud of it. On the other side they want to close the door on that generation. They want to close the door on the next generation of working-class kids having a chance to go to university.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is not a surprise because it comes from the worst education minister we have seen since Senator Amanda Vanstone. It is no coincidence that his mentor was Senator Amanda Vanstone in the other place. At least Amanda got three years in Rome out of her effort. He got three days in Rome for his duplicity—three days at a cost of $30,000. I can imagine him there on the Vespa going down the boulevards, maybe having a pasta and a bit of chianti, proud of his efforts to destroy a fair and equitable education system in this country. What a shadow of a man he is. What a disgrace he is. He has gone a long way from being the Liberal wets' attack dog to being the lap-dog for Prime Minister Abbott. What a disgrace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that everyone in this place talks about education. Everyone in this place talks about why education is a great enabler and a great economic tool to improve society. But the key test is not what you say; it is what you do—it is what you do; not what you say. I am proud of Labor's record. I am proud that, between 2007 and 2013, we nearly doubled education funding. Higher education funding went from $8 billion to $14 billion, student admissions to universities increased by a third, funding for regional universities increased by 56 per cent and there was a 30 per cent boost in regional student numbers—all under the last government, a Labor government committed to education, just like the Hawke and Keating governments. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the other hand, we have this pale, pathetic government over here that is trying to close the door, a government that has cut funding by $5.8 billion, a government that has cut funding for undergraduate places by 20 per cent, a government that is jacking up interest rates not just on prospective student loans but on current student loans. So people who are paying student debts from 10 years ago will be facing much higher interest rates because of this government. As the member for Gellibrand said, there is no mention of that in Real Solutions. What are the results of this? As we saw with the University of Western Australia today, the result is an increase in fees. They are increasing their fees by 30 per cent. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are going to see an explosion in debt. This is not some scare campaign. We are quoting facts and figures from organisations those opposite are quoting. Why is it fine to quote Belinda Robinson from Universities Australia but not mention the modelling they commissioned—modelling that found that a female engineer will have a debt of $203,000 and will take 32 years to pay it off? A female registered nurse will have a debt of $100,000 and will have that debt until the age of 46. They will have to pay it off until then. What a disgrace. Unlike what the Minister for Education says, a registered nurse will not earn $1 million more than an average worker over the life of their career. Look at what NATSEM modelling says. NATSEM, the organisation the Prime Minister said in opposition was the premier modelling organisation in this country, found that the cost of an education degree will be $87,000. This is a disgrace. Those opposite are attacking the classic first degrees for working-class families—teaching and nursing. These are degrees where people do not earn $1 million more than average people. They are closing the door on the next generation of working-class kids to get into uni. This is their legacy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not a surprise, because we have got an education minister who is more interested in anything but talking about education. We have an education minister who is more interested in flying to Europe than talking about education. We have got an education minister who is more interested in conspiring against the former member for Fisher than talking about education policy. We have an education minister who is more interested in masterminding the loss of the unlosable state election in South Australia than talking about education policy. This guy is as much a campaign mastermind as a political mastermind. This is an absolute disgrace and this government will stand condemned in history.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:48</span>):  I think we all enjoyed that puff of hot air from the member for Charlton, who seemed more intent on besmirching people rather than actually debating the points before us today. We are talking about some really significant issues here to do with higher education reforms, reforms that will strengthen our university sector, that will create more opportunities for our students and our young Australians. How many opportunities will there be? Eighty thousand more students each year will be provided with additional university spaces by 2018. That is 35,000 bachelor degrees and 48,000 diploma courses. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These higher education reforms are about fairness and about opportunity. Let us not forget that no student will need to pay one dollar up front. FEE-HELP will remain. The Commonwealth taxpayer will continue to meet 50 per cent of the cost. The government is proud of these reforms. They are reforms designed to save the university sector. Quite simply, in the words of Belinda Robinson in <span style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review</span> today: </span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The short answer is because the existing funding model is not sustainable and a new approach is needed.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">If the Government's package is opposed outright, the quality of the things that our great universities do so well - teaching and research - could be jeopardised. It is simply not possible to maintain the standards that students expect or the international reputation that Australia's university system enjoys without full fee deregulation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what Belinda Robinson, the Chief Executive of Universities Australia, said. I am sure the member for Kingston refers to Belinda Robinson as an ideological frolic. Sure—that is an interesting way to look at it. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I find most perplexing is that those opposite think the chancellors and vice-chancellors of all our universities are irresponsible. It is all scare and no substance. In fact, the University of Western Sydney was the first university in New South Wales to grandfather their fees to provide certainty for students. That is really irresponsible, isn't it. John Dewar, Vice-Chancellor of La Trobe University, wrote on the 15th of this month: 'La Trobe University has on Monday taken the first step to the possible brave new world of fee deregulation by offering students enrolled at La Trobe in 2015 a guarantee that their fees will not increase by more than 10 per cent above the regulated student contribution for each year of their degree.' I am confident universities will set prices responsibly. The alternative consigns the sector to a very difficult future. I guess those opposite want to assign universities to an abysmal future. </span>

How about we take somebody else—Vicki Thomson in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span><span style="font-style:italic;">. </span>Don't be fooled by $100,000 degrees. Vicki Thomson said, 'I repeat, there is nothing to fear from deregulated  fees for undergraduate degrees.' Those opposite are just full of it. Let us not forget it was the previous government that cut some $6.6 billion out of the higher education sector. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These higher education reforms introduced by the Minister for Education are all about providing opportunity—opportunity for more Australians to access higher education, opportunity for our local universities to excel and become some of the best institutions in the Asia-Pacific and in the world.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is time we had universities that were globally competitive, but those opposite just want to stand in the way of the future of our universities.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask the Leader of the Opposition: what is so wrong with wanting to see our universities excel on the international stage? Let us not forget that our universities will be offering more scholarships and the extension of FEE-HELP across a broader spectrum of higher education providers. This government is committed to unlocking educational opportunities for even greater numbers of Australians. Nowhere is it more critical than in regions like Western Sydney, where the additional training and educational opportunities these reforms will create can drive the transformation of the region's labour market and our economy. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:53</span>):  This is probably a good point in this debate to remind the government of what the Hawke-Keating reforms were actually about. The Hawke-Keating reforms were about fees of $100 or thereabouts or, at most, maybe $2,000 for a university degree. These reforms are about $100,000 degrees. You must be some kind of dodgy used car salesman to suggest that these reforms are a natural extension of the original Hawke-Keating reforms—from a couple of hundred dollars to a couple of hundred thousand dollars. This is what this government is proposing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government does not appreciate that the ability to pay off a debt of a couple of hundred dollars may be done in your first couple of pay cheques, whereas the ability to pay off a degree and a debt of a couple of hundred thousand dollars is going to take a lifetime. When I say 'a couple of hundred thousand dollars', I am talking about the cost of a medical degree. What Sydney uni, Melbourne uni and the University of WA are saying is that their medical degree costs could go up to $200,000. It is what we have seen in the up-front fee debate, and it is now what we are now seeing for ordinary domestic university students.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's talk about the capacity to pay and about why this is a debt for life. Let's talk about regional areas such as Tasmania, regional Victoria and North Queensland where the average wages of people is lower than for those in the metro cities. These people do not have the same capacity to pay back debt because their wages are less, yet their fees for university will be just as high. In metro Victoria, as an example, the number of people earning over $78,000—which may be the beginning of an income which can pay back this debt—is 18.2 per cent. But in regional Victoria it is 11 per cent. So they do not have the wages to pay back these debts. That is why it is a debt for life, and that is just for students who graduate when they are aged in their 20s</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's talk about all the mature-age students, particularly women who go back to university later on in life. You are going to saddle them with a debt. What happens to their debt when they retire? Who will pay back that debt? Will it go to their children? What will happen to that debt? This government's plan is about locking out mature-age students from university. This government is about saddling them with a lifetime debt or locking them out. This government's plan is about locking out working class kids, because working class kids will have to make that tough call—will they get a university degree or will they buy a house? When you go for a mortgage, banks are already asking you, 'What is your university debt? How are you going to pay it back?' It is already a factor, even before these reforms come in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These reforms will mean students choose not to go to university, and that will put pressure on regional campuses. I note that the previous speaker mentioned the university of La Trobe, but what she did not mention in her contribution is that the vice-chancellor of the university of La Trobe is already saying that, if these reforms go through, there is a high chance the Bendigo La Trobe campus will close. It will close because student numbers will drop. This is what is going to happen on regional campuses. We have seen it happen in the TAFE sector. When student numbers drop because the debts are too high, courses close. When courses close, academics are laid off, and then the viability of the campus is at risk. It will be a slow death—job by job, course by course, student by student.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What this government is doing is setting the bar way too high on debt levels. What this government is doing is not the Hawke-Keating Labor plan, which was to make a small contribution towards your university fees. This is about a debt for life that is more significant than a car loan, that can only be matched by a mortgage for a home. That is the choice that the government is putting to regional kids.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:58</span>):  It has been interesting listening to the points raised by colleagues across the chamber. I wonder if those comments would have been the same during the Dawkins period, when the major reforms were occurring, because the changes were significant. They were not minimalist. John Dawkins, the Labor education minister from 1987 to 1992, instigated a series of Australian tertiary education reforms which were announced ultimately in a higher education policy statement—the white paper published in July 1988. The Dawkins reforms were targeted at improving the efficiency and international competitiveness of Australian universities. That is why I thank the member for Kingston—sometimes it does not hurt to go back and reflect on what education ministers have done. Certainly over time the greatest reforms in education were under Dawkins and many cuts were made of a substantial nature, including AbSec and changes to Abstudy which took away advantages for Indigenous Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Dawkins reforms were targeted at improving the efficiency and international competitiveness of Australian universities as well as addressing the perceived or real brain drain of talented young Australians overseas. I remind those on the other side of the chamber that the Dawkins reforms included income-contingent loans for tuition fees through the HECS, and conversion of all colleges of advanced education into universities, which was opposed by the Group of Eight universities, who argued that by doing that you were dumbing down courses. The expansion into the TAFE sector was a problem from a university perspective. It took a career pathway away from the vocational focus which universities and the TAFE sector were hooked into. Universities were to provide plans, profiles and statistics to justify courses and research. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, it was noted that under the higher education reforms the number of undergraduate students increased substantially. They increased under those reforms, when we went from free education to where you had to take out a HECS loan. Education and tertiary pathways do need reform to put us into a contemporary position. That also allows students to pay back those loans. We have heard comments from my colleagues about the rate at which they will pay them back and when the fee payment kicks in. These increases in students took place in an era when universities were given an economies of scale paradigm. This was in contrast to the Whitlam government's free higher education approach. It would have been interesting to have listened to Labor members in their party and the caucus arguing against what Dawkins was putting in. If they were consistent with what they have been saying today, they would have been saying it then and they would have been defending those students who were affected. But they did not—I was around at the time and there was silence.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Dawkins needed to create an education system that could produce a dramatically higher number of skilled graduates to power the Australian economy in a competitive, globalised world, while at the same time curbing the spiralling costs of the sector in a tightening fiscal environment. However, crucially, in tackling this fraught task, Dawkins embedded the values of fairness and equality of opportunity in the policy making process. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is no different from what Minister Pyne is doing in the reforms that he has put forward. He is putting forward a proposition that enables students from regional Australia and all around Australia to access universities and for universities to seek out those who are highly competent and highflyers who they would want in their courses. Scholarships will provide those same pathways. Again, I make the point that when I was going through I had a Commonwealth  scholarship. It gave me the opportunity to achieve an outcome.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hotham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:03</span>):  It is great to have the chance to make another contribution on the toxic and unfair first Abbott government budget and in particular to take part in this very important conversation this afternoon about higher education. All of us in the break in sittings have had plenty of time back in our electorates to talk to our constituents about the things they are concerned about. I know that I have been talking to a lot of people about health concerns they have—about the $7 GP copayment. I have heard issues about pensions and the changes being made by those on the other side of the House. It is interesting that no matter who I talk to, whether it is mums, pensioners, young people or even community organisations, pretty much everyone raises a concern about what this government is trying to do with higher education. Day after day in question time the Minister for Education comes in and talks about this perverse equity argument—what about the tradespeople, what about the casual workers, who do not have higher education degrees? I can tell you that that is not how Australians think. The people we talk to in our electorates who do not have higher education do not resent paying taxes so that young people in this country can have equal opportunities. They are concerned about their kids and whether they will get the chance to go to university. They are concerned about their neighbours and their neighbours' children and whether they will have the chance to go to university.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was lucky over the sitting break to have a wonderful visit to Monash University, near my electorate —the member for Chisholm welcomed us there and we were accompanied by the member of the Kingston, the shadow assistant minister for education. She was fantastic—what a fantastic advocate this woman is for higher education and for equal opportunities in this country. She has done a wonderful job going around the country. We had a crowd of students and a crowd of teachers, and gee we had some interesting conversations. I want to talk about one student I met, a young man named Nic—a student at Monash University. Nic comes from Horsham, and he has been lucky enough to go to Monash but he raised some concerns for me about the impact on regional students. We know that Universities Australia and other organisations have made lots of formal pronouncements about the impact on regional universities, but I found it particularly emotive talking to Nic because this is a young person who is concerned about the young people in Horsham where he come from. He wrote me an email after the event, saying:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I am also extremely concerned about the impact that deregulation … will have on rural areas like Horsham. Horsham is home to Federation University, with only 3 study areas offered … This is a small rural campus, with very little international student attendance … Under deregulation … I just cannot see how the campus can remain open …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">If this campus closes, I fear that many people … in the local area would choose to not undertake higher education at all …</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a lot of fun for us Labor people to come in and have a red hot go at the Liberals, but you do have to ask where are the Nationals in this debate. He finishes his email by saying in respect of country people:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">How can their rights be fought for when none of the Nationals local members are fighting for them in the party room and in the parliament?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make some comments about the impact of these changes on Australian women, because we know that Australian women will pay much more for their degrees than men will under the new system. I do not want to go into too much detail, but we know that a female science graduate will pay about $123,000 for a science degree and still be paying off her degree when she is 40 years old. We know that about 40 per cent of women may never pay off their debts in their lifetime. The truth is that women are going to be less likely to study at prestigious universities as a result of these changes. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you do not believe what I am saying, can I just refer you to the basic principle of microeconomics which states that, when the price of something goes up, demand goes down. If you do not understand that, not only should you not be running the country but you should not be running a lemonade stand. We will see fewer women educated at premier universities around the country. It is a good example of where we on this side of the House see education as the great leveller of social disadvantage. This is the way that a young person who was born into a migrant family in Springvale in my electorate of Hotham can go on and become a partner in a law firm or a member of this House. But what we see with a system like the one being proposed is that, instead of it being a leveller of social disadvantage through education, it becomes an entrencher of social disadvantage. Those with the most means go to the best universities and do the best degrees, and that is the way these powers are entrenched. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is so much more that I could talk about, but I do want to mention Real Solutions. It is one of my favourite things to look at. When we need a bit of a laugh in this chamber, we like to bring in Real Solutions. On this serious subject, a promise was made, an ironclad commitment, that university funding would not be changed. This has been a spectacular breach of faith by the education minister; it is one of the worst that we have seen in this budget. Labor will continue to fight these changes to the hilt. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I now turn to the chief brainwashers, who I sometimes think have done so much brainwashing they have brainwashed themselves. The Labor Party have been running a scare campaign on education like the one they ran on pensions. Just the other day we raised pensions again, as we said we would do. And now Labor are doing exactly the same thing with this issue as they did with pensions. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What are we doing? We are expanding the demand-driven system of providing assistance to tertiary education. It means that students studying for higher education diplomas, advanced diplomas and associate degrees will get Commonwealth government support, which equates to $371 million over three years. The people who will benefit from this amount of money are those attending universities in my electorate and at the nearby Charles Sturt University and Southern Cross University. It will also help people who are attending TAFE, because we are also removing all FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP loan fees. These fees are currently being imposed on people who have undertaken higher education and vocational education training loans and are on average about $1,600 a year. Over 80,000 extra students will be able to get Commonwealth government support to undertake tertiary education, and 35,000 extra students will end up with a degree or bachelor course. This is going to help people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. A lot more people will get help with alternative entry courses, which is a phenomenon we see not infrequently—in fact, we see it quite often at universities in my electorate. People start off with a diploma, move to an advanced diploma and then the next thing you know they are enrolled in a bachelor degree. This system has been designed to benefit those sorts of students. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other group who will benefit in is apprentices. We have trade support loans of $20,000. This is a great program and it will mean that apprentices will get assistance as well. Also, if they pay it all back, they will get a 20 per cent bonus. This is much better than the previous system, which was just a $5,000 grant and 'away you go'.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the previous speakers mentioned us having an ideological frolic. I would like to go through some of the ideological frolics that the Labor Party undertook in its last period of government. There was $6.6 billion in cuts to higher education. That was a Labor ideological frolic. Talk about a bull in a China shop; it was more like an elephant in a China shop: they cut almost $3 billion in one year alone. Because they were such bad financial managers, they had to cut money from somewhere to fund their ever-expanding debt. Not only that; Labor put a $2,000 cap on teachers, nurses and other professional people attending further education. Regulation and compliance costs for the university system, which they left in chaos, was $280 million a year. Not only that; they attacked the collaborative research infrastructure funding that was about to go off a cliff. We have reintroduced that. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:14</span>):  The opposition will support the passage of the Customs Tariff Amendment (Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014, also known as the KAFTA tariff bill, and the Customs Amendment (Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation) Bill 2014, or the KAFTA rules of origin bill. I also foreshadow that at the end of my contribution I will be moving some amendments that have been circulated in my name.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Trade reform has been one of the most significant reforms of the modern era. It has contributed to today's dynamic and competitive Australian economy; it has improved the living standards of millions of Australians; it has stimulated the growth of innovative and entrepreneurial Australian businesses; and it has created jobs. It is one of my firmest beliefs that trade, when done right, can be a powerful engine for economic and cultural advancement. There are massive benefits to freer trade when it is done right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The McKinsey report <span style="font-style:italic;">G</span><span style="font-style:italic;">lobal flows in a digital age</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>showed that the flow of goods, services and finance internationally reached $26 trillion in 2012, or 36 per cent of global GDP, which is 1½ times the level in 1990. Today, one in three goods crosses national borders, and more than one third of financial investments are international transactions. Last year, two-way trade in Australia reached an all-time high of $628 billion, with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade estimating that one in five Australian jobs are directly linked to trade. So trade is integral to the future prosperity of Australians and to their economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In government, Labor pursued trade liberalisation for four decades, from the Whitlam government's across-the-board tariff cut to the Hawke and Keating governments' dismantling of protectionist barriers to the Rudd and Gillard governments' pursuit of trade agreements. We inherit from our predecessors on the Labor side a proud legacy of achievement when it comes to trade liberalisation, whether it is John Dawkins, who founded the Cairns group of agricultural exporting nations; the great, late Peter Cook, who helped conclude negotiations for the GATT Uruguay Round; Simon Crean, a friend of this place and of many people in this chamber, who negotiated free trade agreements with Chile, ASEAN and New Zealand; or Craig Emerson, my predecessor in Rankin, who signed major trade agreements with Malaysia and made progress on ambitious new pathways to progress the WTO's Doha Round. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Consistently, Labor has championed freer trade because it is consistent with Labor principles. When it is done right, working Australians can be better off. They can access cheaper consumer goods and they have greater access to the global marketplace. Greater investment in Australia means more activity and more jobs, and trade develops stronger cultural and economic ties, and that means a more dynamic and a more resilient economy. In opposition, Labor, I am proud to say, maintains its support for trade liberalisation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ideal when it comes to trade liberalisation is multilateral deals—multilateral deals that address tariff and non-tariff barriers as well as all the other components of the modern global market economy. It is true, unfortunately, that multilateral momentum has stalled in recent years. Apart from some good achievements that began with Craig Emerson and others, it is the case that the world has slowed its momentum towards multilateral agreements. That is a great shame, because the gold standard when it comes to freer trade is agreements that contain more countries rather than fewer. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should note that among the other negotiations that are happening right now around the world there are plurilateral trade deals as well—the TPP and others—where there is more than a bilateral arrangement in play, but they still fall short of that gold standard of multilateral deals that we want to see in the world. But we can see bilateral FTAs, like the one with Korea that we are discussing today, as stepping stones. I quote my colleague Penny Wong, who said in a speech in July:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… even if we are in the second best political world of preferential negotiations, we should seek to ensure these are used as stepping stones to multilateral agreements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why Australia has seven of these types of trade agreements in place, eight under negotiation and two signed but not yet in force.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In trade, as in business, not every deal is a good deal, which means that Labor are committed to closely scrutinising the outcome of all the Abbott government's trade negotiations. When we do that, we cast a critical eye over the agreements. It is not about free trade agreements for their own sake. We look at them on a case-by-case basis. We want to give peak industry groups and other concerned actors in our economy the chance to have their say. At the end of all of that, we need to make an on-balance judgement in the national interest. As policymakers we do have the responsibility to be hard-headed and to seek an agreement which is, on balance, in the best interests of Australians, whether that be Australian businesses, Australian workers or both.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While Labor initiated negotiations on the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement and made really substantial progress in those negotiations during the Gillard and Rudd governments, agreement was not reached until after the 2013 election and the change of government. Labor MPs and senators have closely examined the agreement in the course of inquiries by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties and the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee. I do want to take the opportunity to thank the members of those committees, one which has reported and one which I understand is about to. I want to thank them for the way they went about their task. People on all sides of politics did their best to get to the bottom of some of the issues that were concerning those who came and gave evidence. I also want to thank those groups who took the time to do that, because our understanding of this deal was greatly enhanced by the effort that people put into those submissions, by the meetings that we had and by the discussions that we had. In particular, I want to thank those who came to see me about this Korea-Australia free trade negotiation because my own understanding of some of these issues was improved by their willingness to spend time with so many of us on both sides of the House, whether in the formal committee process or outside the formal committee process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like many of the people who came to see us and like a number of people in some of the key sectors including agriculture, we were disappointed by some aspects of the deal that the government has delivered. Notwithstanding that disappointment, as I said before, we do believe that, on balance, the Korea -Australia Free Trade Agreement is in the national interest. For that reason, in addition to supporting the enabling legislation before the chamber, Labor supports binding treaty action that will bring the agreement into force.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I examine some of the concerns that we do have about the agreement, let me outline some of the reasons that we on the Labor side believe that the agreement will be, on balance, beneficial. As members would be aware, the Republic of Korea is Australia's third largest export market, our fourth largest trading partner and a growing investment partner. In agriculture, resources and services, Korea is already a significant market for our world-class exporters. Our two-way trade was valued at $30.5 billion in the last financial year alone. Under the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement, tariffs will be reduced to zero on 84 per cent of exports from Australia to Korea immediately, rising to 95.7 per cent of Australian exports in 10 years time. The agreement is forecast to boost Australia's exports to Korea by $3½ billion by 2030, to boost Australia's beef exports to Korea by 59 per cent by 2030, to boost Australia's GDP by $650 million by 2030 and to create an additional 1,745 jobs in Australia in 2015.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In agriculture, this agreement covers the beef, sugar, dairy, wheat, wine and horticulture sectors. These sectors combined employ something like 200,000 workers. Another 150,000 Australians are employed in the related red meat supply chain, manufacturing, processing and transport industries. Many of these Australians live and work in rural and regional Australia or on the fringes of our major cities. They pay taxes, they send their kids to local schools, they run local footy clubs and they volunteer in local fire brigades, and we have a responsibility to look after them. These Australians, as well the businesses that employ them and the communities they sustain, deserve the opportunities that trade agreements can deliver through increased market access. Other manufacturers will also benefit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to give one example to the House. Blackmores is one of Australia's leading natural healthcare companies. They will benefit from increased market access to grow their exports. This Australian company employs approximately 800 staff, most of whom are based here in Australia. It manufactures vitamins and other products in this country predominately from Australian ingredients. A Blackmores representative informed the Senate inquiry into this agreement that it would directly benefit from an 8 per cent tariff cut on its products exported to Korea. This tariff cut will have a direct impact on Blackmores' selling price, which should then deliver an increased market share, giving the company the capacity to reinvest in its business to fund further expansion, which means more jobs. Blackmores believes that the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement will translate into at least 10 per cent, and possibly 20 per cent, annual growth for the company in Korea. As a leading brand, this growth will lead the way for other Australian exporters into the Korean market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the services sector, Australian law firms will soon establish joint ventures in Korea and hire local lawyers. Australian accountants will soon be able to work in and invest in Korean accounting firms. Australian financial services providers will be able to supply certain financial services and a range of insurance and insurance-related services. The Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement is just one stepping stone to trade liberalisation and more prosperity for Australia in the Asian century and beyond. It is not perfect, but on balance it is a positive step. It will not just facilitate economic exchange, it will also promote cultural exchange, enriching both our nations in the process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But like a number of other people who have studied this issue, and like a lot of the stakeholder groups that spoke to the formal committees or to members of parliament individually, we do have our concerns about aspects of this deal. That is why I will be moving an amendment at the end of my contribution to put some words around some of those concerns. But let me try and explain them first. The first is around what is known as an investor-state dispute settlement provision. It is commonly referred to as an ISDS. Labor does not support the inclusion of ISDS provisions in trade agreements. Labor does not support provisions that confer greater rights on foreign businesses than on domestic businesses or provisions that constrain the ability of the government to make laws on social, environmental and economic matters, and Labor will not ask this of its trading partners in future agreements that we take part in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement, negotiated by Prime Minister Howard and his government, did not include an investor-state dispute settlement provision. Having determined in 2011 that Labor governments would not include such provisions in future trade agreements, Labor successfully negotiated our free trade agreement with Malaysia without an ISDS provision. The Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement, finalised by this government, does, unfortunately, include one of these ISDS provisions. It says something about the nature of these provisions that the government felt the need to negotiate some related safeguards, and I will talk about those in a moment, but let me make it clear that Labor does not support the inclusion of an ISDS provision in this or any future agreement. But what we cannot do today or in the consideration of this legislation is vote down an ISDS provision. There is no such provision in the bills before us. And should these bills be defeated, the treaty will not then enter into force.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the course of two parliamentary inquiries, informed by the written and verbal submissions of many concerned Australians, Labor has examined the impact of the ISDS included in the text of the agreement finalised by the government, as you would expect. In broad terms, the agreement carves out from its investment and ISDS provisions measures to protect human health and the environment and existing measures and space to adopt new measures in sensitive areas, including security, human health and creative arts. The agreement also provides that non-discriminatory actions to protect legitimate public welfare objectives do not constitute expropriation. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has advised that these are the most comprehensive carve outs of any trade or investment agreement to which Australia is a party which includes ISDS provisions. Members of this place will be aware that Australia is currently defending an ISDS claim relating to world-leading tobacco plain packaging legislation introduced proudly by the former Labor government. This is the only such claim involving the government of Australia. It has been made by Philip Morris Asia under a 1993 bilateral investment treaty with Hong Kong. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has advised that safeguards in the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement would prevent a similar challenge by a Korean entity to tobacco plain packaging or similar legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's decision to support these bills and the agreement itself should not be misunderstood as extending support to these ISDS provisions. What we have to weigh up is the cost to workers, exporters and our economy if the parliament does not pass the necessary enabling legislation before us. In blunt terms, a no to the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement would cement decades of competitive disadvantage for Australia. Modelling from ABARES shows that without this agreement Australia's share of the Korean beef market would fall to 28 per cent by 2029, with one of our key competitors, the United States, the key beneficiary. But with the agreement in force, our share of the Korean beef market is forecast to rise to 43 per cent. That increase in market share means more national income. It also means, of course, more jobs in that industry. The negotiation of treaties is reserved for executive government. Governments are ultimately accountable to the people through the ballot box for their exercise of executive power. So, today Labor urges the Abbott government to rethink its decision to include an ISDS provision in the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement and renegotiate the agreement to excise this provision before it enters into force. Should that not happen, a future Shorten Labor government would seek to negotiate with Korea for the ISDS provisions to be removed from the agreement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2010, long before the conclusion of negotiations on the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement, the Productivity Commission recommended that:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… any IP provisions that are proposed for a particular agreement should only be included after an economic assessment of the impacts, including on consumers, in Australia and partner countries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the government has not followed this sound advice. Accordingly, Labor is concerned about the inclusion of intellectual property provisions in the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement. We share these concerns with academic and industry submitters to the two parliamentary inquiries into the agreement. And I want to take a moment to pay tribute to the work of the member for Gellibrand, a fellow class of 2013 new member on this side of the House who has genuine longstanding knowledge and interest in this area and who has played a substantial role in helping us understand some of the complexities of this part of the agreement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The national interest analysis tabled by the government in relation to the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement says this about this issue:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Consistent with Australia's existing obligations in the Australia-US and Australia-Singapore FTAs, and to fully implement its obligations under KAFTA, the Copyright Act 1968 will require amendment in due course to provide a legal incentive for online service providers to cooperate with copyright owners in preventing infringement due to the High Court's decision in Roadshow Films Pty Ltd v iiNet Ltd, which found that ISPs are not liable for authorising the infringements of subscribers.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The so-called 'requirement' was questioned by witnesses before both parliamentary inquiries, and even the Attorney-General's Department described it as more of a 'risk assessment'. The government is yet to clarify this matter and has not made available exposure draft legislation or presented legislation amending the Copyright Act to the parliament. Labor urges the minister to clarify the government's position when he sums up the second reading debate. And I can confirm that Labor reserves its right to determine its position on any proposed changes to the Copyright Act, once published or introduced to the parliament, based on their policy merit or otherwise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor believes that Australians should have the opportunity to fill job vacancies where they have the capacity to do the job that is required. We are concerned therefore about the government's decision to deny itself the capacity to impose labour market testing on contractual service providers from Korea under the 457 visa program. Section 457 visas allow foreign residents to work temporarily in Australia. In most cases there is a requirement for labour market testing to demonstrate local skills shortages. Many existing free trade agreements provide for movement-of-people arrangements for categories of skilled workers, including executives and senior managers, specialists as intra-corporate transferees, independent contractors, and contractual services providers. I note that in both the ASEAN-New Zealand and Malaysia Free Trade Agreements negotiated by Labor policy space was reserved for labour market testing on contractual service providers.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As this chapter locks in existing arrangements, no significant change is expected in the number of skilled workers entering Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During a hearing of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee, senior representatives from the Department of Immigration and Border Protection advised that they did not believe there would be any significant additional movement of people based on the provisions in the Korea agreement. Currently the number of Korean nationals in Australia on 457 visas is 2,495 primary holders and 2,575 secondary holders, and numbers of that scale do not have a significant impact on local jobs. Indeed, if some of those holders are here for business investment purposes, the impact on local jobs could even be positive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor notes the assurances provided by the national interest analysis and testimony from senior officials, and we will hold the government to account on this point. We also urge the government to put in place measures to more accurately track visa entrants based on free trade agreement provisions, including exemptions from labour market testing requirements. Labor also urges the government to take seriously concerns about the non-enforceable nature of the labour standards incorporated in the agreement. I invite the minister to outline to the House how concerns about labour standards in Korea will be addressed in the framework of the agreement finalised by his government.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recognising the inclusion of tariff reductions in the agreement—and the legislation before us—Labor urges the government to reverse its cuts to automotive industry programs and work with employers and unions to ensure Australia has a sustainable automotive components sector. Having goaded Holden to abandon manufacturing in Australia, the Abbott Government does have a particular obligation to ensure our world-class auto component industry—and the jobs and skills it sustains—does not similarly exit our shores.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor shares industry concern about disharmony in the application of rules of origin and the requirements around a certificate of origin versus a declaration of origin. There is serious concern from ACCI, among others, that the provisions in the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement will increase, and not diminish, red tape for business. Labor urges the government to listen to business to ensure the potential of the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement is fully realised. Should the fears of business come to pass, Labor encourages the government to act quickly through established processes under the agreement to sort out the mess and make market access in Korea a reality for Australian exporters—small, medium and large.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I have already said, Labor supports the bills before the House. We do support the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement. For reasons I have just outlined, though, this support is not without reservation. There is a broader point at play as well about globalisation. When we are talking about freer trade and trade liberalisation, it is not just a matter of giving Australian businesses access to opportunities and creating jobs—as important as all of that is—but we do have to contemplate as a parliament, if we care about the future of this country, how we are going to teach and train our people to occupy the best parts of the global value chains in the international trading system that will increasingly characterise the future of this country and the dynamic region we find ourselves in and the global economy as a whole. When we talk about these very specific negotiations and deals, we should also think about what it means for our people—whether we can demonstrate to them the benefits, not only of jobs but opportunities of all kinds; whether we have the right higher-education system to set people up to occupy the best parts of these global value chains into the future. That is how we will make globalisation work for us, and not against us. My personal view is that we cannot be defensive when it comes to some of these sorts of agreements. We do need to think that we are good enough, confident enough, competitive enough and smart enough to grasp the opportunities of the Asian century to make sure that we do not instinctively and reflexively curl ourselves up into a ball and hope that the world does not notice us. There are tremendous opportunities in freer trade. This deal itself is, on balance, a good deal for Australia. It is not without its limitations, and I have run through those today, but, on balance, it is a good deal for Australia and it should be a stepping stone to more ambitious trade agreements—not just bilateral ones, but plurilateral and ideally multilateral—so that Australians get the best access to the best opportunities in the best region of the world. KAFTA a small step towards this, but a step towards it is nonetheless.</span>

This will be achieved through Infrastructure Australia conducting rigorous and sound planning to identify quality projects and to avoid wasteful investment.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us be clear, Infrastructure Australia will not be the decision maker; the minister will be. However, these changes will ensure Infrastructure Australia plays a greater role in the assessment of projects and provide more-strategic advice to ministers and governments. It is critical to base project selection on rigorous analysis and sound planning in order to avoid wasteful investment. Clearly, this government is focused on long-term planning based on robust evidence-based findings through greater understanding of the critical issues facing Australia's infrastructure and land transport system. With these changes the government demonstrates it is committed to building the infrastructure of the 21st century and to ensuring Australia has the productive infrastructure it needs to meet the challenges ahead. I commend the Infrastructure Australia Amendment (Cost Benefit Analysis and Other Measures) Bill 2014 to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:45</span>):  I rise to speak on the Infrastructure Australia Amendment (Cost Benefit Analysis and Other Measures) Bill 2014. I begin by echoing some of the concluding sentiments expressed by the member for Lindsay, the previous speaker. I think it is just unfortunate that those sentiments about the importance of independent decision-making and rigorous cost-benefit analysis cannot be applied to this government's infrastructure record so far or indeed, lamentably, to the bill which is before us now.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of the Infrastructure Australia Amendment (Cost Benefit Analysis and Other Measures) Bill 2014 is to amend the Infrastructure Australia Act, it is said, to make it a function of Infrastructure Australia to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of those infrastructure projects which are nationally significant and which also involve Commonwealth funding of at least $100 million. So far, so good but, as ever with this government, closer scrutiny is warranted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 11 May 2005, Labor announced that it would establish Infrastructure Australia if elected to government. Subsequently, on 2 August 2007, the then Leader of the Opposition, Kevin Rudd, detailed Labor's plans for Infrastructure Australia, stating that it would have three divisions: to deal with policy and regulatory issues, driving reform on legal, tax, planning and infrastructure finance matters; to audit the adequacy of the nation's infrastructure, identify weaknesses and prioritise projects; and, lastly, to evaluate the business cases of projects and project financing options including private public partnerships and to manage the probity process. Consistent with that policy, the Infrastructure Australia Act was enacted, and Infrastructure Australia was established, in April 2008. In short, Labor delivered on its election commitments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What of the coalition? Before the last election, the coalition stated that it would:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… strengthen the role of Infrastructure Australia, to create a more transparent, accountable and effective adviser on infrastructure projects and policies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, the coalition promised that it would:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">require all Commonwealth infrastructure expenditure exceeding $100 million to be subject to analysis by Infrastructure Australia to test cost-effectiveness and financial viability. This will include dams, telecommunications, hospitals, educational institutions, energy projects and water networks but will not extend to defence projects;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, despite this breadth, the coalition's policy document is confusing, because a few pages down it states that the cost-benefit analysis requirement would apply to 'all infrastructure projects worth more than $100 million', not just ones where the Commonwealth infrastructure exceeded $100 million. This confusion is relevant. Does it apply to the capital value of a project or to the level of Commonwealth funding to be applied to a project?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, this bill chooses the soft option, with the cost-benefit analysis to be applied only to projects where the level of Commonwealth funding exceeds $100 million. This means that for a project worth, say, $5 billion for which a state government was seeking Commonwealth funding of up to $99 million there would be no cost-benefit analysis conducted by Infrastructure Australia. In any event, as with so many of their pre-election promises, the Liberal Party walked away from this commitment and invested massive amounts of money in projects like the East West Link in Melbourne and WestConnex in Sydney, without a cost-benefit analysis to be seen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, as you are well aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Mitchell, in Victoria we have seen quite the opposite. The Victorian Liberal-National government has steadfastly refused to provide the people of Victoria the full facts and figures to enable them to make an informed decision on the East West Link project. The Prime Minister was asked about this on Melbourne radio. He confessed that he had not seen the business case but was prepared to take the Victorian government's word for it. How does that sit with the nice words expressed so eloquently by the member for Lindsay earlier and with the avowed purpose of the bill which is before us? This is despite, or perhaps because of, initial Infrastructure Australia analysis indicating that this project is a dud. The best evidence we have suggests a cost-benefit ratio of between 0.5 and 0.8. Instead of having regard to the evidence the Prime Minister warned against 'analysis paralysis' and blindly committed $1.5 billion to the East West Link, all the while promising a cost-benefit analysis of projects worth or with expenditure more than $100 million. I note that $1 billion of these funds is for stage 2 of this project, before we have even seen plans for it, before we even know where the tunnel will be situated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the lead up to this November's Victorian election people in Melbourne are seeing a desperate state government clinging to a road to nowhere. At one level, that is apt symbolism of the Baillieu and Napthine administrations and why Victorian Labor is so well placed looking to November. The desperation of the Victorian government is one thing; the complicity of the Abbott government quite another. All the rhetoric about transparency and accountability before the election has been shown to be empty. In one sense we have moved on from the Howard-era roads of National Party importance. Here it is the Liberals being backed in with absent evidence and absent process. The height of this shameless politicking to the detriment of Melbourne's development is the commitment of $1 billion of Commonwealth funds to stage 2 of this project. It is really on the never-never. This alone nails the lie on the part of this government. On infrastructure investment they are incapable of placing the national interest before their political interests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On to process, which should be straightforward. Proper process requires Infrastructure Australia to rank projects by benefit-cost ratio and other relevant subjective criteria prior to a government decision on which projects to fund. Not the other way around. Labor's amendments, which I will speak briefly to later, go to this matter and of course to the election commitments of the government. We propose, in essence, to hold them to their word, to help the Prime Minister, who was so determined just over a year ago to build confidence and trust in politics, do just that. It is pretty obvious he needs our help in this regard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Grayndler, the shadow minister, has said, linking the need for a cost-benefit analysis to whether a project has received a level of prior Commonwealth funding commitment completely fails to understand the proper process that all major stakeholders are seeking. Linking cost-benefit analysis to a commitment of Commonwealth funding means that public transport projects like the Melbourne Metro and other urban rail projects will not be assessed when this proposed amendment is coupled with the federal government's policy of not funding public transport—an ideologically bizarre aberration that is condemning Australia's cities to congestion, reduced productivity and reduced liveability. More broadly, this notion of proper process seems entirely foreign to this government. Proper process is of course important so that we do not end up wasting vast sums of taxpayers' money on dud projects like the East West Link and so that we enable all asset classes—roads and public transport—to be assessed and their benefits reviewed transparently before significant government sums are invested.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite coalition claims that this bill delivers on pre-election commitments, it really does nothing of the sort. The bill before us simply makes doing a cost-benefit analysis for projects of more than $100 million a mere 'function' of Infrastructure Australia, not a requirement as was promised. This is more coalition sleight of hand, another deception—you might even say it is mean and tricky. It is not clear from the bill what will determine the exercise of this function. This is an important matter. Can the minister explain why the language used in the legislation is not more compelling if the government is genuinely concerned to see cost-benefit analysis conducted and made available—and to see it form the foundation of significant infrastructure investments? Until this important question of form and function is addressed, this bill does not and indeed cannot rectify the coalition's broken promise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Deputy Speaker Mitchell, as your neighbour and as the member for Scullin, an outer suburban electorate experiencing significant population growth at the moment, I am particularly concerned to see infrastructure delivered based on need—transparently and accountably. Since I have been in this place I have taken, and I will take, every opportunity to speak on these issues on behalf of my constituents and indeed on behalf of your constituents just down the road—or just down the railway, as we would hope, as well. The communities I represent are deeply and rightly concerned that transport infrastructure has not kept pace with growth. The 'Access Denied' campaign being conducted by the City of Whittlesea speaks to this. It prioritised the O'Hern's Road interchange, a project supported by the former Labor government, and the extension of the South Morang rail line, a project likewise supported by Labor in government. These are projects I am a passionate advocate for. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But these are only two examples of the pressing need in outer suburban communities for better transport infrastructure. In relation to the rail extension, there is an obvious point to be emphasised: due to the Prime Minister's bizarre ideological fixations, we cannot see public transport brought into the infrastructure equation—a matter compounded by the form of this legislation. As city theorists talk about agglomeration and as people in Scullin experience the reality of living in the suburbs at a time when jobs are increasingly located in and around the CBD—I commend the work the Grattan Institute have recently done on where productivity is taking place in our cities, particularly in Melbourne and Sydney—how can we not regard boosting our public transport capacity as a central plank of meeting our infrastructure and productivity challenges, not to mention our liveability and sustainability challenges?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course this conversation is not solely about Scullin; these questions of infrastructure delivery and urban Australia are about all of our major cities. When we make better cities, we enable better lives for the four out of five Australians who live and work in our urban communities. Sadly but obviously, however, when our national government neglects these people, these four out of five Australians, the reverse is true—as the experience of the past 12 months shows us. The government which on day 1 shut down the Major Cities Unit has carried on just as it began. While modern Labor, under the Whitlam, Hawke-Keating and Rudd-Gillard governments, has built our cities, successive conservative administrations have turned their backs on them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a critical aspect of this debate. Our cities are prized national assets. Getting greater productivity out of our big cities is vital to Australia's future. Recent work by the Grattan Institute that I previously mentioned has highlighted the fact that our cities are real engines of economic innovation, central to maintaining national living standards—the places where three-quarters of jobs are located and 80 per cent of GDP is generated. I note a particularly interesting and challenging speech given by Jennifer Westacott, the CEO of the Business Council of Australia, on 30 July this year. She set out the importance of having a cities policy and a national conversation about cities, in particular about infrastructure and taking a hard look at cost-benefit analysis—how it should be framed and what we do with it. It is an address I commend to all members of the House. I think all members opposite would take some learnings from it. It is clearly not a partisan contribution. How prudent is it to ignore the challenges presented by congestion, to deny the imperative of working to better connect people with opportunities—jobs, for sure, but also those other elements of living decent, dignified lives?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That <span style="font-style:italic;">The Economist</span> Intelligence Unit has again crowned Melbourne the world's most liveable city is both a source of pride for Melburnians and simultaneously a wake-up call for all of us, because Melbourne today is at risk of fragmenting into two cities—a prosperous core and an outer half with much lesser opportunities. With proposals rigorously assessed and costed by Infrastructure Australia—back when it was a genuinely independent agency—Labor governments saw targeted investments made in urban roads and public transport in support of the national interest and in support of the aspirations and needs of many suburban families. These investments continue to be of vital importance. In fact, this a growing issue as urbanisation continues, especially as outer suburban Australia rapidly expands in population but not in numbers of jobs located there.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the shadow minister has set out, Labor has proposed significant and vital amendments to this bill. These amendments are to clarify that the references to '$100 million' are to project capital cost rather than Commonwealth funding alone; to require that payments for projects over $100 million in value under the Land Transport Infrastructure Act can only be made after Infrastructure Australia has published its evaluation—that is, to assess first and fund later, not the other way around; to require IA to approve a standard method for preparing cost-benefit analyses; and to strengthen transparency and public disclosure of project assessments. In essence, as I said at the start, Labor is trying to help the coalition to do the right thing by the people of Australia by ensuring funding is directed towards need and not directed by political calculations. In the lead up to the last federal election, the coalition promised to:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… ensure better infrastructure planning, more rigorous and transparent assessments of taxpayer-funded projects, and develop a much firmer and clearer infrastructure plan for Australia's future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, as I and others on this side of the House have repeatedly said during debates on successive infrastructure bills, the government has refused to increase transparency about how infrastructure projects are evaluated and which ones are funded. In fact, this government has sought to do the opposite. It seeks to concentrate even more power with the minister, harking back to the bad old days of regional rorts. The Australian taxpayers deserve better than this, Australian cities need better than this and Australia's productivity requires better than this. Australia's infrastructure needs are best met through independent and transparent decision making with a long-term focus. This is what Labor's amendments do and I encourage those opposite to support them.</span>

                    <a href="241067" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr COLEMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Banks</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:00</span>):  It is great to have the opportunity to speak about infrastructure in this House, as it is such an important economic driver for our nation. Before getting into the detail of the Infrastructure Australia Amendment (Cost Benefit Analysis and Other Measures) Bill 2014 and the very clear contrast between the government and the truly appalling record of those opposite in the infrastructure space when government, I want to reflect for a moment on why infrastructure is so important. One of the distinguishing characteristics of infrastructure is that it is an economic gift that keeps on giving, because when you build infrastructure—whether it is a road, a bridge or other important infrastructure—you build it once and 20, 30, 40 or 50 years down the track it is still delivering those productivity benefits to the economy. It therefore makes sense for government to take a very forward-leaning approach when it comes to infrastructure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is in line with a suite of different initiatives by the government in relation to infrastructure. I would highlight at the macro level the legislation in relation to the states. It encourages states to recycle assets and to invest in productive infrastructure by giving them a 15 per cent financial incentive. That is really important, because often an infrastructure project might be on the borderline as to whether or not it goes ahead from an economic basis. With the federal government providing that 15 per cent bonus to the states when they recycle assets for the purpose of creating new infrastructure, that will tip numerous projects over the edge and that will mean more than $50 billion of incremental infrastructure will be generated through that incentive to the states. That is a very important initiative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to contrast the direction we are going in infrastructure with that of the previous government, because you really cannot talk about infrastructure in this country without talking about the largest infrastructure project that has been conceived in recent years. Labor's NBN is the biggest example of grotesque mismanagement of infrastructure. We must always remind people of the extraordinary incompetence and mismanagement that was involved here. This matters because the NBN was not some small project done by a local council or a suburban progress association. The level of discipline and rigour that went into thinking around the NBN would put suburban progress associations to shame. There would be a call for the president of the progress association to resign if they had similar planning to what Labor did with the NBN. This was very, very bad.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We started out with a notion that the NBN was going to cost about $10 billion: $4.7 billion was going to be put in by taxpayers and the private sector was going to stump up with the remaining $5 billion or so. What actually happened was because there actually had not been any substantive planning in relation to the NBN, what the likely returns would be or how the $10 billion would be recouped, there was not a lot of interest in co-investing alongside the federal government. Around the same time, it became increasingly apparent to the previous government that $10 billion was not going to quite cut it. We saw this spectacle of the previous Minister for Communications, Senator Conroy, chasing the Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, around the country and trying to deliver the bad news that, 'We have got it all wrong. $10 billion is not going to be enough. We don't know how much it will be. We just know that $10 billion is not the right number.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Peter Hartcher described those weighty conversations like this:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In those first airborne conversations, the Prime Minister barely hesitated. He decided that, if the private sector was unable to build the system, the Government would.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On fibre to the premise, there was notion that every single home in the country had to have fibre directly to it even if it had already had perfectly good cable running to the front door. On this, Peter Hartcher says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Rudd instantly saw the attraction of this option. The big drawback? The cost. It would cost much more than the $10 billion or so for the original proposal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is my favourite line from Peter Hartcher's chronicling of that unfortunate period in our history. After committing to the project, in this discussion:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Next came the detail work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So they went: 'We are going to do it. We are going to build the fibre to the premise, even though we do not actually need it. We will commit to doing that and then we are going to subsequently work out how much it might cost.' The number they ended up with was about $40 billion. That was also massively wrong. Really, it is about $70 billion, based on the independent analysis that was conducted late last year. $6.5 billion was spent prior to the election to cover three per cent of the population. It was just an absolute management disgrace. When public policy schools conduct case studies in the future of how not to govern and how not to purport to manage a project, this will be in the honours course. That is because it is an absolute disgrace. That is characteristic of Labor's approach to infrastructure. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I come from New South Wales, and we are a state that has been crying out for infrastructure for so long. We had 16 years of Labor inadequacy. They talked about the Parramatta-Epping Rail Link, which must have been announced four or five times, about the North West Rail Link and about lots of road projects. There were lots of announcements for the news on Sundays—always on Sundays—but they were never followed up. In New South Wales, we became a little cynical, as a people, about infrastructure projects. It has taken the leadership of the coalition government under the Premier, Mike Baird, to really get things going. That is where the federal government and its contributions have become so important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The WestConnex is a fantastic infrastructure project and will be of huge benefit to people in my electorate. It duplicates a road called the M5 East, which runs towards the airport in inner south-western Sydney. That road is two lanes in and two lanes out; it is just not enough. It needs to be duplicated, and it will be. It will be duplicated not only because of the leadership of the state government but also because of the absolutely critical contribution of the federal government. The federal government made a straight cash contribution of $1.5 billion and provided a $2 billion concessional loan, which basically meant that the state was able to pull that project forward substantially.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My friend and colleague in St George, the member for Barton, the Treasurer, Premier Baird and I were at Beverly Hills in the electorate of Barton the other day while the first geotechnical work was getting underway on the M5 East duplication. This is not just an announcement; this is actually happening. The M5 East will be duplicated. It will happen in the next five years and engineers estimate that it will save someone driving from Beverly Hills in my electorate to the city in peak hour about 25 minutes. That is enormous. It is a massive productivity benefit. It is also of great benefit for family life, of course, because less time on the roads means more time at home with families, and that is very important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other important infrastructure project in Western Sydney is the second airport. I am 40 years old and for my entire life people have been talking about building an airport in Western Sydney. I think that most people on both sides of the House know in their heart of hearts that it needs to happen. It took this Prime Minister to actually have the guts to do it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the important local contributions of the member for Lindsay and the member for Macarthur in making sure that that project is structured in the ideal fashion, it will be built, and there will be huge road improvements in Western Sydney. We will see the upgrade of Elizabeth Drive, Bringelly Road, Northern Road and all those roads around Western Sydney near the airport. These are huge infrastructure upgrades, and they will be delivered prior to the airport being completed. So there will be an infrastructure benefit in the very near future. That is what we need, because we need infrastructure to grow the economy. We do not need talk about infrastructure, and we do not people simply saying that they support infrastructure; we need people to actually build infrastructure. That is what this government is doing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Returning to the Infrastructure Australia Amendment (Cost Benefit Analysis and Other Measures) Bill 2014, the bill will see that Infrastructure Australia will conduct a cost-benefit analysis on projects receiving Commonwealth funding of $100 million or more. It will also require Infrastructure Australia to develop a 15-year list of priorities, and that is a very worthy endeavour because that is what we need as a nation. We need to take a step back. Instead of deciding priorities on an ad hoc, case-by-case basis, we need to strategically, thoughtfully, methodically go through and say, 'What are the infrastructure priorities?' I know what those priorities are in my part of the country, and WestConnex to the M5 East is absolutely top of the list. There are other priorities all around the country and Infrastructure Australia will work through those in an orderly fashion and ensure that we have a strong infrastructure plan going forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a nation, we need to get shovels on the ground, to get the cranes into position and to create infrastructure. I have an anecdote about someone in my electorate who said to me the other day that he is absolutely sick and tired of sitting in traffic on the M5 East every day going into work. He said that it used to take him about half an hour to 35 minutes to get into the city, and it now frequently takes him an hour. When that road was created, it was frankly inadequate for the purpose at the time, and it has become less and less adequate over time. I am very pleased that in advocating the importance of the M5 East duplication to members of the government we have had success in securing that important funding of $1.5 billion in cash and the $2 billion concessional loan to the state government, because both of those things are required.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We must not allow a return to the days of infrastructure as some sort of political plaything. We cannot go back to the days of people committing tens of billions of dollars on the back of an envelope. We must have an orderly approach in this area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second airport initiative will create tens of thousands of jobs during the construction phase. Importantly, when the airport is completed, we estimate that Australia's GDP will increase by about $24 billion. That sounds a bit abstract; you might ask, 'What will it mean if GDP goes up by $24 billion?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Basically it means we get more stuff done. We get more goods into Sydney in a more timely fashion and we get the flow of people into our city more quickly. We have huge opportunities in freight. Sydney Airport is quite constrained in what it can do with air freight. Bringing more freight into the Western Sydney airport will be a great opportunity. A lot of people in Western Sydney may not have to drive a long way to work, as the airport will create a substantial hub. There will be industrial development in the vicinity of the airport. New roads are going to slash travel times in the area around Badgerys Creek. We will see substantial productivity benefits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill is a sensible approach to adding to our already very strong record in infrastructure development. It is a massive contrast with Labor's appalling mismanagement, principally through the NBN. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:15</span>):  I was very interested in the previous contribution and the talk about the need for us to be thoughtful, careful and methodical in our infrastructure planning and not to make the prioritisation of projects a political plaything. I think the Infrastructure Australia Amendment (Cost Benefit Analysis and Other Measures) Bill 2014 takes us backwards in that regard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Infrastructure Australia was set up by the previous Labor government to ensure that we indeed had thoughtful, careful and methodical planning of our infrastructure and an assessment of cost-benefit analysis. The federal government had originally tried to avoid the commitment they made at the election that every project over $100 million would be assessed by Infrastructure Australia. They fell foul of the Senate when they initially tried to move a set of amendments to the Infrastructure Australia legislation to remove the requirement for this assessment. That was rejected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now they are supposedly honouring this commitment, but in the most bizarre way. The commitment now is: 'We will assess this infrastructure once we have already approved it. Once we have approved it and provided the federal funds for the infrastructure under this scheme, we will do the assessment.' What is the point of that? The whole idea of having an Infrastructure Australia assessment and determining a cost-benefit analysis and what other externalities of value there may be is that you use that to prioritise the expenditure. But what we are doing here turns the entire thing on its head. It is saying, 'We are going to prioritise and make our decisions, and after we have made our decisions we are going to go off and do an Infrastructure Australia assessment.' It simply does not make sense.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us look at this in the context of the project that we are supposedly going to see in Western Australia—that is, the Perth Freight Link. The Perth Freight Link was announced with great fanfare. I think it was leaked to one of the Western Australian papers in advance of the budget. Then in due course it was announced in the budget. The Perth Freight Link comprises three components: the Roe Highway extension, with eight kilometres of road, a reconfiguration of Stock Road and a reconfiguration of High Street. The Roe Highway extension makes up about two-thirds of the project's overall cost, at about $740 million. The remainder of that project is $460 million.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After the announcement we heard Assistant Minister Briggs say at a press conference that the cost-benefit analysis of the project was 'out of the ballpark; it is over five'. The cost-benefit analysis showed that it had a benefit-to-cost ratio of more than five to one. We subsequently found out that that was only a draft cost-benefit analysis and it was not available for anyone to see—and it was certainly not anything that could be used to found the prioritisation of the project. More significantly, it transpires that this indeed related to only one part of the project, the Roe Highway extension.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the state parliament, after the announcement was made that we were going to get the Perth Freight Link, questions were asked of the Commissioner of Main Roads. He was asked about the estimation of the $460 million that had been allocated to the non Roe Highway parts of the project and whether or not this represented a reasonable cost estimate. Let alone the cost-benefit, was it a reasonable cost estimate? The commissioner said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The commonwealth has a propensity to make these announcements, as you well know, but the reality is that the Main Roads department and this government will be implementing and designing the Roe 8 extension, and at this stage we have not actually got design plans that are worthy of public scrutiny …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here you have a parliamentary secretary of a Liberal government in Western Australia saying, 'We do not actually have design plans that are worthy of public scrutiny,' yet we have a government telling us that they are going about infrastructure planning in a thoughtful, careful and methodical way and that this is not a political plaything.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is quite clear that this concept of the freight link was hastily patched together to try to cover this hole that was in the budget because they were taking out the $500 million that was in the previous budget for important and much in-demand rail extension projects in Perth. These were projects which had been committed to by the state Liberal government of the day, saying that they would be reliant on federal government support. Because they were taking that money out they had to come up with another project, so they hastily cobbled together this notion of the Perth Freight Link. This is a project which, quoting government members in Western Australia, is not at a stage where one can make a reasonable cost estimate of it because we have not actually got design plans that are worthy of public scrutiny. Yet apparently we have made a decision in our budget that this project is going to get funding. Do not come in here and talk to us about your careful, thoughtful and methodical planning. We are back to the good old days of the RONPIs—the roads of National Party importance—except this time expanded out so we get a few roads.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I put in an FOI request to the federal minister's office for the details he has of this project. The really amazing thing is that, while this is a major project which has apparently been the subject of careful, methodical and thoughtful planning, the minister apparently has only one set of emails in his office relating to this entire project. That is a pretty extraordinary set of circumstances. It is also quite amusing when we actually see the one email chain that was apparently the only thing in the minister's office about this project. It was a series of emails that started from the federal infrastructure department to the state main roads department, and their subject was 'the Perth Freight Link'. They said, 'We understand Minister Briggs is planning a visit to the site of the Perth Freight Link on Monday. Could you urgently send us some locations?' They said, 'If it can be in the electorates of Swan or Tangney that would be ideal but not necessary.' It was obviously not a political decision at all! It was clearly not a political prioritisation—it just so happened they would have liked it to be either in Swan or Tangney!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Main Roads state agency were obviously concerned. The first email that came back said, 'Hi Allan and Peter. Can you advise if you know any more?' Then the next person sent it on to someone else, asking 'Do you know anything about this, guys?' And the next guy asked, 'Are you able to help on this? Main Roads has been approached about this. We are interested, of course, but our office has not received any contact as yet, so we are a bit in the dark.' Interestingly, this matter was not described by Main Roads as 'the Perth Freight Link'; they called it 'Truss coming here for a Roe 8 thing?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We quite clearly have a situation where, in my view, the old, very controversial Roe Highway stage 8 project, which has been around for some 15 years, has been dressed up, covered and surrounded with a few other very expensive bits and pieces—$460 million of extra pieces—and been called 'the Perth Freight Link'. It is quite clear that there has been no detailed, thoughtful, careful or methodical planning of this at all. Indeed, what we are going to see with this project is very much the government's vision—the prioritisations will be made on a purely political basis. There will be a post decision-making process whereby these projects will be looked at by Infrastructure Australia. But it will be to undermine the very essence of this project.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the government is continuing to have problems on this and of even coming to terms with the nature of this project. We had that very fabulous, very switched-on, lovely man—the assistant minister, Minister Briggs—last week telling a tunnelling conference: 'In Perth, Western Australia, we have committed to the Perth Freight Link, which is, for those of you not from Western Australia, the railway extension that will have a dedicated freight route all the way past the airport to Fremantle Port.' That is absolutely brilliant! It is apparently a railway project! Again, this goes to show the amount of thoughtful, careful planning that has gone into this cobbled-together process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we do need more infrastructure funds in Western Australia. I just want to correct something for the record. Minister Briggs has shown that he cannot read his own budget papers. He contested my claim about WA's unfair deals. Let me spell out some of the numbers here. The Grants Commission's estimates for WA's population for 2014-15, which is the relevant figure that we should be using, is 11.1 per cent—not the 10.8 per cent claimed by the assistant minister. Secondly, WA has been allocated $4.7 billion of the total allocated budget of $45.3 billion—that is 10.37 per cent, not 11.7 per cent. The assistant minister really needs to get across the details of WA funding and show us where he got this 11.7 per cent figure for WA's share of infrastructure funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even if it was 11.7 per cent, that simply is not good enough. Western Australia produces over 16 per cent of Australia's GDP. We are being absolutely unfairly dealt with under the Howard GST agreement. The only way of rectifying this in the short term is for WA to get a decent and fair share of the infrastructure budget. I will say again that the budget papers show that Western Australia will get 10.37 per cent—much less than half of the figure going to Queensland. This treatment of Western Australia is simply not acceptable.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Durack</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:31</span>):  I am pleased to speak on the Infrastructure Australia Amendment (Cost Benefit Analysis and Other Measures) Bill 2014, which is important to constituents Australia-wide who seek to progress the expansion of infrastructure to underpin the development of Australia in the 21st century. We all have visions—for our cities, for our communities and regions, and indeed for Northern Australia—for developing potential, and a critical factor underpinning the realisation of the vision is the development of good, solid, productive, sustainable infrastructure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2014 Infrastructure Australia amendment bill will amend the 2008 act to clarify legislative and administrative arrangements for Infrastructure Australia—established under the Infrastructure Australia Act 2008 and which came into effect on 9 April 2008. The amendments will essentially clarify the role of Infrastructure Australia in assessing projects of over $100 million. It is seeking to include a qualification to include proposals that are seeking Commonwealth funding of $50 million dollars toward the total estimated capital expenditure, or in relation to other proposals as determined by the minister responsible for infrastructure. The amendment will ensure that Infrastructure Australia has the function of evaluating cost-benefit analyses as part of its broader evaluation function. In addition, the amendment will also include a definition for 'proposal', obviously providing clarity for all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is committed to Building Better Infrastructure—the infrastructure for the 21st century. It is part of our economic action strategy to build a strong and prosperous economy that will boost jobs and liveability for our children's' children. The budget has laid out a $50 billion dollar infrastructure investment program, for development of essential infrastructure in rural, remote, regional and urban Australia—we need roads and bridges, rails and ports to underpin development and growth and to realise prosperity well into the future. Transport challenges had been looming for some time under the previous government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government's policy agenda will: target investment in productive infrastructure; seek to complete jobs faster; partner with state governments; and leverage more private investor funding. We are already witnessing investment in better roads and I am pleased for my electorate of Durack to see the following infrastructure commitments: North West Coastal Highway, Minilya to Barradale section—$174 million for upgrades; Great Northern Highway, Waddington to Walebing section—$74.7 million for upgrades; and the Great Northern Highway upgrade at Port Hedland—works are completed on the $260 million section.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Notwithstanding current commitments to fund the economic artery of Australia—otherwise known as the Great Northern Highway, which links Perth, the ports and the Pilbara—the artery needs further attention.</span>

                    </a>  We are continuing in that vein, thank you, Member for Perth. It is the lifeline to the north—to iron ore, oil and gas, tourism and proposed new agricultural expansion. It is a lifeline to the national economy. Part of the Great Northern Highway, the road between Kununurra and Wyndham, in its current state represents both a productivity and a safety issue, thereby inhibiting development notably in pastoralism, tourism and mining and resources. We know there are many undeveloped mineral leases in the region. This poor road links with the Wyndham port, which also has latent potential, just like the Broome port—both of these are noted in <span style="font-style:italic;">Pivot </span><span style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span style="font-style:italic;">orth</span>, the recently released report of the joint select committee inquiry into the development of Northern Australia. Only infrastructure planning and investment at a broad regional and national level can underpin the prospectivity of the ports as they relate to both regional and national economic potential. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another example of much-needed infrastructure investment relates to the single lane bridges that still exist in north-west Australia, for example between Broome and Derby, again on the Great Northern Highway—not so great in parts, you are probably thinking. These seriously impact on development, including pastoral expansion and agriculture, again recommendations in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Pivot North</span> report. Only last year I was personally impacted by the head-on collision on a single lane bridge of two cattle trucks en route to Derby from Broome. Not only does this poor infrastructure have an impact on development but also it is, of course, a significant safety issue for Durack communities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The obligation of government is not just to fix up existing infrastructure; it is also to build the infrastructure needed to open up new areas of potential, especially in regional and remote Australia. By way of example, I refer to the proposed development of the Tanami Road, a priority recommendation for upgrade in <span style="font-style:italic;">Pivot North</span>. This is one road that can open up areas by improving access. The west-east link section would link the Pilbara to the southern part of Tanami Road, creating a more direct route from Port Hedland to Alice Springs and giving access to mineral provinces, providing impetus to the sector. It would also support the Aboriginal communities along the road, who are often cut off from goods and services when the road is cut due to poor weather conditions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Tanami Road section from Halls Creek to Yuendumu would improve access to the Kimberley and benefit many industries, for example, by reducing costs to primary producers and the resources sector, creating better access to southern markets and opening a new avenue for tourism. It would create a direct freight corridor between the Kimberley and South Australia, shorten the journey by some 1,100 kilometres and 17 hours of travel between the south-east and the north-west, give greater access to the national rail network through Alice Springs, and enable more rapid resupply or reinforcement of the north-west for defence purposes, along a secure inland route.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to make sure that Infrastructure Australia is well placed to support the infrastructure agenda. The government has already set some priorities, including assessing project proposals that are deemed to receive government funding of $100 million or more, undertaking an audit of nationally significant infrastructure and developing a 15-year plan on infrastructure priorities. As a member of the Standing Committee on Infrastructure and Communications, we are currently undertaking an inquiry into government planning for infrastructure projects. I look forward to seeing the results of this inquiry, which I am confident will bring about positive changes with respect to how government plans to implement infrastructure in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I have highlighted the importance of infrastructure planning, evaluation, construction and some identified priorities. I reiterate my support for the bill, which shall clarify legislative and administrative arrangements for Infrastructure Australia. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we can take a step back in this debate, everyone is in furious agreement that infrastructure investment is a crucial part of our economic investment. Infrastructure investment is an enabler for further economic activity and, quite frankly, besides providing improved quality of life, is making it easier to travel around this country and to promote economic activity. We are looking for other drivers of economic growth as the mining boom comes off and we are seeing a dramatic reduction in capital expenditure by that sector. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Too often, we in this place are criticised for our disagreements, for the perception that bipartisanship is lacking. However, this is a public policy area where both sides of the House should agree. Labor understands the fundamental importance of sound infrastructure investment to ensure continued economic growth and to increase productivity. We believe that government should make sensible investments in nationally significant infrastructure and that this should be done in a timely and cost-effective way. This is, of course, why Labor created Infrastructure Australia: to give us an independent and transparent blueprint for our current and future infrastructure needs. There should be bipartisan support for Infrastructure Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I now turn to the Liberal amendments to the Infrastructure Australia Act. It is entirely appropriate that the form and functions of Infrastructure Australia are reviewed and that options for reform are considered, particularly when these reforms enable more thorough assessment of proposals and more efficient delivery of projects. But to seek, as this bill does, to require a cost-benefit analysis to be conducted for major projects only after the Commonwealth has decided to invest more than $100 million does not meet this objective. Furthermore, it is a direct contradiction of their own election commitment, which clearly stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… we will require all infrastructure projects worth more than $100 million to undergo a cost-benefit analysis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a clear tendency for this Liberal government to say one thing before an election and to do another afterward, but we believe that with Labor's help we can actually help them keep this promise. They have broken plenty of promises on changes to pensions, education, healthcare funding and superannuation. Now they are trying to break a promise on cost-benefit analysis for infrastructure projects—but, with Labor's help, we can help them keep their promise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's amendment will adjust the government's trigger point for a cost-benefit analysis from the $100 million of Commonwealth investment as outlined in the bill to the capital value of the entire project. To do otherwise would mean the government plans to commit the money before checking whether or not it is a good idea. Not only does this fundamentally undermine the current role of Infrastructure Australia, it will not produce the best outcomes for the community.    It is a simple notion: assess first, fund later—not the other way around. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a sad fact that the current way that this bill is constructed is symptomatic of this government's approach to infrastructure. They are more concerned with headline announcements, funnelling cash out the door, getting the Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, as the member for Perth indicated, into a high-visibility vest to announce things, rather than looking at what projects actually stack up. It is pure common sense to say: you assess a project before you decide whether to fund it. And to assess a project you need to set an appropriate trigger point based on the total capital value of the project, not the desired level of Commonwealth investment—and that is what Labor's amendments seek to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is also seeking to amend the land Transport Infrastructure Act to require that payment for major projects can only be made after Infrastructure Australia has published its evaluation. We will also seek to require Infrastructure Australia to approve a standard method for preparing cost-benefit analyses and to strengthen transparency and public disclosure of project assessments. This is basically a commitment to consistency and transparency of project assessments. This is the only way to ensure all stakeholders are confident that the investment is sound. This has been called for by regulators, including the ACCC and the RBA, advisers such as the Productivity Commission and the sector more broadly, including IPA, BCA, UDIA, Moving People Coalition and environmental and community NGOs. This is vital if we are to continue the central position Infrastructure Australia has in the heart of infrastructure investment decisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When Infrastructure Australia was established by Labor, in 2008, it was determined that the agency should evaluate the business cases of projects, project finance options, including private/public partnerships, and manage the probity process. Now we are seeking to expand that to provisions around cost-benefit analyses. But if we do this we must do it through a proper process, not after the government has made a decision to fund, but as a precursor to any government funding decisions. To do otherwise would not only give a blank cheque to the government but it would revert to the blatant pork-barrelling approach of the Howard government, where we would see worthy projects that by all other standards were completely necessary and viable overlooked to instead favour projects with base political returns, often to the National Party. I will return to that later in my contribution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this case a government that could be investing in public transport is choosing to ignore that sector completely. The sad fact is that the Abbott government does not believe in funding public transport, no matter how beneficial a project may be. It will not be built, because it will not be subject to a cost-benefit analysis, because it will not have been funded. This is a circular argument that is not only illogical but will leave Australia in a much worse condition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We only have to see this poor approach to infrastructure investment in a few projects that have already been approved by this government. The Abbott government has approved massive projects such as the East-West link, Westconnex and the Perth Freight Link, none of which have been subject to a proper cost-benefit analysis. The member for Perth highlighted the many issues with the Perth Freight Link, and I will not traverse that area again. But in the case of the East-West link and the Westconnex around $3.5 billion has already been delivered to the states for these projects well in advance of construction actually beginning. The one case that actually had a cost-benefit analysis, the East-West link, had a cost-benefit ratio of 0.8, which means that for every $1 of public investment in this project it will deliver 80 cents of economic return. We are spending $1 to make 80 cents. It is bizarre. Not even Minister Truss would see that as a good return on taxpayers dollars. Yet they are going ahead with this project, rushing headlong into committing money before the Victorian state election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only do we look at the faulty cost-benefit analyses and the faulty funding of these projects, but they are able to spend this $3.5 billion by cancelling funding for two approved public transport projects that would improve the liveability of some of our major cities and would make a major contribution to our national infrastructure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, Labor is committed to sensible and transparent investment in infrastructure projects, principally through Infrastructure Australia. The inaugural chair of Infrastructure Australia, Sir Rod Eddington, described the new organisation as follows:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It introduces a bold new approach to identifying, planning, funding and implementing infrastructure of national significance across Australia. It also introduces rigorous and robust economic analysis of infrastructure investments prior to government decision-making.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a sensible and transparent approach to infrastructure investment, and we are rightly proud of this direction, as we are proud of our broader record in infrastructure investment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the previous Labor government came to office, Australia was ranked 20th in the OECD for spending on infrastructure as a proportion of GDP. After six years in office, because of Labor's significant level of investment, Australia was ranked first. These investments include doubling the roads budget to $46.5 billion; investing $13.6 billion in urban rail infrastructure, which is more than all our predecessors combined; investing $3.4 billion in the rail freight network; and lifting road grants to local government by 20 per cent. This is in stark contrast to the Abbott government, which has frozen the indexation of financial assistance grants to local government for the next three years, meaning that grants will not be increased in line with CPI and population increases. I challenge the members on the other side, particularly those members in large regional electorates with a lot of crumbling road infrastructure, to explain this abhorrent decision to their local councils, which will be bearing more and more of the burden of maintaining roads that are crumbling as we speak.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a representative of a regional area, I know that strategic investment in infrastructure is a major economic driver that helps to grow the capacity of areas such as the Hunter. Of course, the responsibility of both funding and delivering infrastructure lies overwhelmingly with the states, and there are a number of projects that, if left to the New South Wales government to fund solely, would never get off the ground. But there are some great examples of infrastructure investment by the last government in the Hunter region that make great sense and will contribute to the economic and social wellbeing of the Hunter region. Principal amongst them is the $1.7 billion Hunter Expressway. This is a shining example of the capacity of federal and state governments to work together to deliver a piece of infrastructure that is a remarkable benefit to the Hunter region. I would like to acknowledge the work of both the member for Hunter and the then minister, the member for Grayndler, for their efforts in bringing these projects to fruition. Importantly, in stark contrast to the East-West link, this had a positive cost-benefit analysis. This had a cost-benefit analysis of around five. For every dollar spent on it, it was going to return $5 of economic activity. We are seeing that contribution already in my region. And I was very happy for the Deputy Prime Minister to open the project. It is good that he was there and he got to see this great piece of infrastructure that they got to complete—and I acknowledge their efforts in completing it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A second piece of local infrastructure in the Hunter region that benefitted from the Labor government, and I hope can benefit from future governments, is the Glendale transport interchange. This project is a vital piece of infrastructure for the fast-growing western suburbs of Newcastle and northern Lake Macquarie. In this one suburb 6,000 additional residences are coming into a suburb that already has a 10,000 strong industrial estate. We have a very large shopping centre with one exit and entry and we have regular traffic jams that back up for several kilometres. So, further investment, building on the $37.5 million already committed by all levels of government to this piece of infrastructure, is very necessary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But broadly we must approach infrastructure investment through using sound economic analysis—using cost-benefit analyses and looking at the analyses first and the funding second. Otherwise we are in dire risk of returning to a much poorer sort of infrastructure policy development, infrastructure policy development exemplified by the Howard government in their regional rorts affair. The regional rorts affair saw $1.3 million given to a Queensland dairy that went bust less than a month later; $500,000 for a North Queensland hotel with bikini-clad barmaids. If a business wants to operate in that area, that is fine. If people want to go in there and have a drink, that is fine. I question why you need half a million dollars of Commonwealth funding to promote it. We also saw $6 million for an equine centre in Tamworth that was supposedly given on the basis that Tony Windsor would not have an association with that particular centre. Best of all, we saw $5.7 million for a heritage railway that went bust twice, had a derailment and had its bridge burn down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are classic examples of infrastructure investment under the last coalition government, infrastructure investment led by the National Party, and I applaud the National Party for wearing its heart on its sleeve. They fight hard for money for their areas. Often it is without justification or it is at the expense of projects that are more justified by cost-benefit analysis. But they owned their pork barrelling. They fight for their pork. They get their pork—$5.7 million for a heritage railway that burns down, derails and goes bust twice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

I applaud their effort because they are honest about the fact that they are putting economic analysis second behind political imperatives. The unfortunate thing is that they are controlling infrastructure investment for a national government. Labor's amendments try to reverse that. Labor's amendments try to help the coalition to keep an election promise to do a cost-benefit analysis before they make their infrastructure investments, before they repeat their mistakes on the East West Link. These amendments should be supported by the coalition. This is an important bill which can be rescued. It can improve the way Infrastructure Australia operates and the way investment is made in this country. I commend Labor's amendments to this bill.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TAYLOR</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hume</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:53</span>):  I rise to speak on the Infrastructure Australia Amendment (Cost Benefit Analysis and Other Measures) Bill 2014 at a time in our history when there is no question that investment in roads, rail and telecommunications is absolutely critical. That is something that we can definitely agree on with those on the other side of this House. The bill before the House takes a small but important step in the right direction by clarifying legislative and administrative arrangements for Infrastructure Australia, with a particular focus on cost-benefit analysis and prioritisation. This is something that the last government did not seem to know very much about. But to understand the importance of this and how the last government treated it, we need to look at the broader problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own electorate of Hume, people intuitively know we have underinvested in infrastructure, particularly in roads, rail and telecommunications, in recent years. For instance, the Barton Highway between Yass and Canberra is of grave concern to many of my constituents, as it is to me. Understandably, commuters ask: if we pay our fuel taxes, why can't we see funding to fix roads in our area? The infrastructure backlog in Australia has been variously estimated at somewhere between $455 billion and $770 billion. These numbers are almost big enough to rival Labor's debt burden. A 2012 Infrastructure Australia report to COAG identified over $70 billion worth of priority projects that we should be moving on immediately. They also identified that we are falling behind on maintaining our existing road and rail. So there is a big backlog not just in new projects but in maintenance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again in my electorate of Hume we saw a complete failure of investment under the recent Labor government. The NBN failure is well known, and we saw that loud and clear. It has been talked about at length in this House. We have also seen transport infrastructure failure, and a nice example—or not so nice example, as the case may be—of that is the Hume Highway which is now basically a conveyor belt of trucks in the evenings. We see the B-doubles going from Melbourne to Sydney and back because rail has failed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Addressing this backlog is made even more critical when we look at the emerging trends in the Australian economy. First, we are clearly facing a dramatic slowdown in mining investment in this country. Mining investment grew from around $30 billion at the beginning of this century to up to $120 billion a year in the last 12 months or so. It is now falling away dramatically, aided by the antimining policies of the previous Labor government. On top of that, we have frugal consumers and we still have a relatively high dollar. Without infrastructure investment, in coming years we will not see the sort of growth and prosperity we know we need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second trend that we face and we should be deeply concerned about is a productivity crisis. Productivity growth has slowed dramatically in recent years. We know that capital productivity, in particular, is at the heart of this. We are not making enough investments, despite what we hear from those on the other side. We did not see enough investment in the last few years, and we have not made investments in the right capital projects. That is very clear. So Australia faces a significant challenge in the coming years. Whilst our exports are growing strongly and we are set to continue to grow those exports strongly, we will need to lift our rate of productivity growth if we are to continue to enjoy the increases in our standard of living that we have grown used to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a speech in November 2013, the deputy governor of the RBA, Philip Lowe, emphasised the potential for infrastructure investment to address that declining productivity growth. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If this lift in productivity growth does not take place, then we will need to adjust to some combination of slower growth in real wages, slower growth in profits, smaller gains in asset prices and slower growth in government revenues and services – in short, slower growth in our average living standard. So the debate about productivity should not be seen as an esoteric one just for economists. Productivity growth matters and it matters a lot to our future living standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Lowe went on to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the years ahead, it is unlikely that Australia's comparative advantage will lie in the production of standardised mass-produced manufactured goods for the global market. Instead, we have tremendous opportunities in a range of more specialised high value-added goods and services, where it is the quality of our ideas and the quality of our execution that is the key. Whether or not we can seize these opportunities depends critically on our human capital and our infrastructure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Later in his speech he went on to say:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The benefits of investment in transportation infrastructure are well known. Some of these are quite obvious, while others are more difficult to see, although no less important. Among the more obvious benefits is a reduction in travel times and costs for both people and goods. There can also be favourable social impacts through reducing travel stress and increasing the connectedness of communities.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those of us who come from regional communities know that connectivity is king, and good connectivity comes from good infrastructure. Unfortunately, Labor did little to address these issues. Most importantly, Labor's infrastructure investment processes were totally politicized and lacked rigour. We know that good infrastructure investment decisions need to be depoliticised. We know that we need the rigour of cost-benefit analysis. That is something the Labor government failed dismally to achieve, and let me illustrate that. Only 14 per cent of Labor's stimulus expenditure was spent on productive infrastructure, and, of the $80 billion of stimulus expenditure, none—not one dollar of it—went to Infrastructure Australia for approval.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are numerous examples of inferior project selection and inadequate assessment of the costs and benefits of public infrastructure projects … In particular, government decisions can become politicised and may be based on inadequate information and assessment of the costs and benefits of projects … </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was with reference to what we have seen over the last seven years of the Labor government. We know Infrastructure Australia was effectively marginalised by the Labor-Greens government, as most famously evidenced by their pre-election approval of the Parramatta to Epping Rail Link project, which did not feature on IA's list of priority projects. The Deputy Prime Minister has pointed out:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">When Anthony Albanese set up Infrastructure Australia in 2008 he made it his personal lapdog, largely answerable to him. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">IA was sidelined on any real decision-making, forced to play catch-up and chase its tail to justify projects Labor had already announced without consulting its expert advisory body.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What hypocrisy we are hearing from those opposite. Labor's road and rail funding projects, its big-spending response to the global financial crisis, and its infrastructure election promises were all announced without being assessed by IA. We need look no further than the NBN for a clear example of that kind of investment, with a significant impact—a huge impact—on the government's balance sheet. There was no cost-benefit analysis. We saw extreme politicisation. Indeed, it turns out that that decision was made on the back of a serviette.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know there is a serious problem with project funding and financing in this country. In the absence of an intervention from this government, state underinvestment in infrastructure is absolutely inevitable. Again, the Productivity Commission report I referred to earlier notes that the Commonwealth has a comparatively wider and more efficient tax base, despite heavier levels of investment from the states and territories. This has led to large transfers from the Commonwealth to the lower levels of government for the purpose of financing infrastructure. But, as Moody's told us late last year, state and territory debt levels have ballooned since 2008 and are projected to increase into the foreseeable future. That will limit the funding state governments can provide for infrastructure. Ironically, though, the financing challenge does not arise because of a lack of money available for infrastructure. We heard from the Minister for Trade and Investment this morning that many private sector investors say there is plenty of money sitting on the sidelines waiting to be invested. The issue is more a reluctance of investors to take on the construction and patronage risks and/or the difficulties of charging for the use of the infrastructure. So, looking forward, we need to find a sustainable way in which to finance our infrastructure needs over the long term. Regardless of whether it is the private or public sector doing the financing, it is likely to be easier if we consider different options for pricing, funding and prioritising transport infrastructure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me turn now to the solutions to these very difficult problems. Our government has committed to delivering massive transport infrastructure investment—$50 billion by the end of the decade, the equivalent of eight Snowy Mountains Schemes. This new infrastructure will drive $125 billion of spending across the continent and support the next wave of national prosperity. Understanding the importance of this to jobs and productivity, the government has made significant commitments to additional road and rail funding in the recent budget. Of particular importance, we are providing incentives for the states to recycle assets—privatising assets they currently own and reinvesting the proceeds in new roads. This Asset Recycling Fund we will build the finances to support this government's record package of infrastructure investment; $5 billion has been committed to provide financial incentives over five years to the states and territories to sell assets and reinvest the proceeds. It will leverage significant investment by the private sector and create massive new opportunities for investors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst these are extremely important and constructive policies, we will need to go further to fund the infrastructure gap. Born and bred on the land, over many years I have had cause to unpack the issue of regional road funding, and road and rail funding more generally. I have come to the conclusion that we need to go further in solving all this. There is a remarkably simple way to do that, and that is a user-pays system that guarantees that money goes back to the owners of the roads. We already have the key elements, paid through our fuel prices, right now. Whether we drive a truck or a car, every one of us pays a certain amount of excise per litre of fuel purchased. However, the current system has two problems. First, the money collected in fuel excise and registration fees does not go directly back to the roads, and it should. We have started to change this in the latest budget by hypothecating—allocating directly—the increases in the excise back to road funding, but this is just the beginning. At the moment the owner of the road is not directly paid for their role in building and maintaining that road, whether it is the local council or the state government or even the federal government. I think we should be doing that. To me, this is the single most important principle we could apply.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second issue is how that user charge should work. Should it be based on every litre of fuel we buy, or the distance we travel or the weight and size of our vehicle? Should we charge more at peak hours in our capital cities, when extra vehicles, particularly trucks, have a big impact on congestion? Moving towards true user charges—something that has been floated in the last 24 hours by Ian Harper, leading the competition review—would allow us to drop the fuel excise, registration fees and traditional road tolls as we embrace a system that better reflects the cost of the vehicle to road maintenance and construction. These changes will not and should not happen overnight or in one hit. We should start with heavy vehicles on targeted roads, and I am confident that we will see that from some states in the very near future. As we prove the model, we should progressively roll it out to other vehicles and across all roads. The benefits of moving down this path are broad ranging. As I said, outlined in the draft report of the competition policy review published this week, we would expect to see a large increase in road investment and easier access to finance. And, importantly, it will take the politics out of allocating road and rail funding as investors, public and private, bet on where the needs are greatest. We should see increased investment in rail where it has genuine competitive advantages as the relative cost of road and rail becomes more transparent to investors—no tolls, no excise, no regos. Some of the smartest reforms are the simplest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For many years—since about 2007, in fact—we have seen the Labor government fail to sufficiently invest in rail infrastructure and as a government we want to address that. We have said we will invest $300 million in the Melbourne-Brisbane rail link and allocate further investment on the coastal corridor. That will take trucks off the roads; it will support a better drive and a safer drive; and it will mean fewer trucks on the Hume Highway going through my electorate. It will have the benefit of creating regional freight hubs as well. For the grain growers in the wheat belt of New South Wales, this will give many options they do not have today. They will be able to send their wheat to Newcastle, Port Kembla, Brisbane or Melbourne. The Barton Highway is also a failure of the previous Labor government; we are upping investment in the highway, including development of a staged duplication plan. Finally, our significant investments in black-spot and Roads to Recovery programs are important responses to a dire infrastructure backlog.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian public deserves better. We are no longer crammed into the back seat of some kind of juvenile joy ride as we were under the Labor government—the grown-ups are back at the wheel. We know that good infrastructure investment needs to be de-politicised, and we know it also needs to focus on costs and benefits. This is something the Labor government failed to do, and we are committed to do. I fully commend this bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:08</span>):  It is a pleasure to rise to speak in respect of the Infrastructure Australia Amendment (Cost Benefit Analysis and Other Measures) Bill 2014. It would be nice if the Abbott government would make good on its pre-election commitment to require cost-benefit analyses of infrastructure projects of more than $100 million, but unfortunately this bill does not make good on the pre-election commitment that was made. I remind the House of that pre-election commitment: </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">To ensure more rigorous and transparent assessments of taxpayer-funded projects, we will require all infrastructure projects worth more than $100 million to undergo a cost benefit analysis. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is an attempt to convince the Australian public that that commitment is being made good, but the Australian public will not be fooled by this bill. It is clear that this government has no intention of meeting its pre-election commitment to require cost-benefit analyses on projects worth more than $100 million or to publish calculations that demonstrate the significance of projects. If the government did intend to make good on the election commitment, then the government would have voted for the Labor amendments to the so-called Asset Recycling Bill earlier this year. The Asset Recycling Bill of course was more accurately named in the Senate as the 'encouraging privatisation bill'. The Asset Recycling Bill was aimed at creating a fund to encourage privatisation of assets by the states. Labor moved amendments to require that before the moneys could be spent in that way cost-benefit analyses had to be prepared and conducted, but, as history records, the government opposed those amendments. The government did not want to make good on its election commitment for cost-benefit analyses in respect of the so-called Asset Recycling Fund—better named the 'encouraging privatisation fund'.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a shame that this government has failed to agree to these basic transparency obligations that the government told the Australian people it would adhere to in order to get elected. We know that this is a government that would have said anything to get elected—and in fact did say anything to get elected. It is the government of no cuts to health, no cuts to education, no changes to the pension, no cuts to the ABC and SBS—all of these things that were said prior to the federal election. What is another one? No adverse changes to superannuation—that was another pre-election promise that was made. It is a government that lacks legitimacy because it said anything to get elected to convince the Australian people that it would not take the axe to superannuation, to health funding, to education funding, to SBS and the ABC, to pensions. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What have we seen, Deputy Speaker? $80 billion worth of cuts on the government's own budget papers to health and education and changes to pensions so that people will work to 70 and the pension will no longer increase in a way that meets the real cost of living increases for pensioners. This is a government that does not care about the widening inequality in Australian society, that does not care about pensioners, that goes after pensioners' ability to meet their costs of living in blatant contradiction of its election commitment that it made in order to convince the Australian public to vote for the LNP. It is a government that has decided to make cuts to funding universities, despite its commitment that there would be no cuts to education. But what have we seen? Twenty per cent cuts in funding for universities, the deregulation of fees that mean there are going to be $100,000 degrees at the University of Western Australia and new fees for research degrees, PhDs, that will put a dampener on Australia's quest to become a genuine knowledge economy. Then there is the real interest rate that will continue to compound, meaning that if you are a woman who takes time out of the workforce to raise kids, you will pay more for the same degree than a man who does not take that time out of the workforce to raise those kids. I use the gendered language advisedly, Deputy Speaker, because we know that today it is still largely women who take time out of the workforce to raise their families. It is those women who will be adversely affected by these changes and by these cuts. This is a government that is prepared to say anything in an attempt to convince and mislead the Australian public on its intentions, but this year its behaviour has been laid bare for all to see.</span>

I do not think it is funny that there will be people who do not get a prescription filled because of what this government is doing to health. I do not think it is funny that there will be kids who, because they will have to choose the price of a mortgage and the price of a university degree, will decide not to follow their dream to go to university. I do not think any of that is funny. I do not find it amusing whatsoever that working-class kids and middle-class kids are going to have these new obligations on them, this lifelong debt, this compound interest rate, the cuts to higher-education funding and deregulation of fees that will lead to $100,000 degrees and the disincentive to undertake PhDs in research.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports an independent and transparent Infrastructure Australia. That is why Labor created Infrastructure Australia in 2008, making good on a pre-election promise of Kevin Rudd. That mob over there has a lot to learn from Kevin Rudd. We promised Infrastructure Australia and we delivered on it. What did they promise? They promised cost-benefit analyses for all infrastructure projects worth more than $100 million. What are they delivering? They are putting the cart before the horse. To put it politely, they have things all turned around.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite promised they would bring in cost-benefit analyses for all projects worth more than $100 million. What have we seen? We have seen the Abbott government approve massive projects such as the East West Link, WestConnex and the Perth Freight Link that have not undergone proper cost-benefit or wider analysis by Infrastructure Australia, despite being clearly within the scope of their pre-election promise. Funds have already been paid to the states for the first two projects. No cost-benefit analysis has been done but they have handed the money over to the states, saying, 'All right, we trust you. Here's the money. Off you go.' What about the cost-benefit analysis that you promised the Australian people you would undertake? What has happened to that?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other issue with this bill is that it seems to have a fundamental misunderstanding about what a proper cost-benefit analysis process would be. A proper process would be for Infrastructure Australia to rank projects by cost-benefit analysis and other criteria before the government decision on which projects to fund. Linking the need for a cost-benefit analysis to the question of whether a project has received a level of prior Commonwealth funding completely fails to understand that proper process. If you say, 'We're going to give the people the money. We're going to fund the project and then we're going to do an analysis to find out whether we should actually do it,' that is putting the cart before the horse in a major way and it fails to understand the proper process that major stakeholders are seeking.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My voice is nearly gone, but I still have enough voice to point out the problems with this bill. We want 'assess first and fund later' not the other way around. It is not that difficult a concept. We want this bill to actually align with the coalition's pre-election commitment. I know it is a novel concept for those opposite that you keep your promises. We want to help them keep their promises just as we want to help them make good the representations they made to the people of Griffith when they said I was scaremongering about a GP tax, when we were talking about it during my by-election campaign earlier this year. The Prime Minister and the foreign minister came into town and said, 'We have got no plans for a GP tax.' We want to help you make good on that representation you made to the people of Griffith. When it comes to this bill we want to help you make good on your pre-election commitment. It was one of the things that you said in order to get elected. We want to help you meet that, because that is what we believe in. We believe in the changes that would seek cost-benefit analyses for projects of above $100 million.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So do not take it from me. The independent review of the bill shows that it does not meet the coalition's pre-election commitment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the announcement of this legislation, Anthony Albanese, the shadow minister for infrastructure and transport and member for Grayndler, made some very salient points about why this bill does not meet the pre-election commitments of the Abbott government. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Tony Abbott's promise to conduct cost-benefit analysis on infrastructure projects worth more than $100 million lies in tatters a year after he made the undertaking in a speech to Canberra's National Press Club</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Albanese continued:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the 2014 Budget, Mr Abbott paid billions of dollars in advance funding to road projects like Sydney's WestConnex project and Melbourne's East-West Link, despite having conducted no proper cost-benefit analysis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The shadow minister went on to point out the breach of the promise Tony Abbott made in his own book <span style="font-style:italic;">A Strong Australia</span>, on page 99:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There will be a published cost benefit analysis for any infrastructure project to which a Coalition government commits $100 million …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the shadow minister said, the commitment was repeated. Since then, Mr Abbott, the Prime Minister, has scrapped public transport projects like the Melbourne Metro and one very dear to my heart the Brisbane Cross River Rail project, which had been subjected to proper analysis and judged by Infrastructure Australia to represent value for money. Cross River Rail was a very important infrastructure project for Brisbane. What do we have now that the Prime Minister has walked away from that project? We have a second-rate bus and train tunnel that has been highly controversial in Queensland. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the shadow minister said, prior to the election the Prime Minister was prepared to say anything to illustrate his claimed interest in infrastructure investment. But, as the shadow minister said, a year later not a single infrastructure project created by the coalition has begun and the Prime Minister continues desperately to seek credit for old infrastructure projects conceived and commenced by previous Labor governments. Do you want to talk about asset recycling? This is idea recycling. This is announcement recycling by the Abbott government. We have not seen any of those new infrastructure projects. We have not seen any making good on the commitment to cost-benefit analyses. Instead we have seen budgets allocating billions of dollars to projects that have not had the rigour of an independent cost-benefit analysis from Infrastructure Australia. This is in direct contradiction to the pre-election commitment this government made. It is part of the pattern where they said one thing before the election and have done the opposite after the election—just like the cuts to education, just like the cuts to health, just like the changes to the pension, just like the cuts to the ABC and SBS, and just like the adverse changes to superannuation. This is an opportunity to start to correct that pattern—to change this bill to require those cost-benefit analyses.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="241589" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs McNAMARA</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dobell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:23</span>):  One of the most important roles of government is to properly plan and provide major infrastructure for communities. The Infrastructure Australia Amendment (Cost Benefit Analysis and Other Measures) Bill 2014 continues to build on this government's strong commitment to building the infrastructure of the 21st century. Infrastructure is a key to unlocking economic prosperity through enhancing the productive capacity of Australian industry and business. Infrastructure is crucial to the prosperity of regions across Australia, including the New South Wales Central Coast where for too long underinvestment in infrastructure has resulted in a decline in the quality of our road systems—at a time when rapid population growth has put unprecedented demand on our ageing infrastructure. Lack of investment also meant less opportunity for local businesses, particularly in the construction industry, hence retarding growth and creating fewer job opportunities. This is why this government is committed to building the infrastructure of the 21st century—the roads of the 21st century, the bridges of the 21st century, the rail of the 21st century and the airports of the 21st century. Through these projects, we are ensuring that Australia has the productive infrastructure required to meet future demand and the creation of economic opportunities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government's commitment was demonstrated through our first budget, in which we laid out a historic $50 billion infrastructure plan to deliver vital infrastructure across Australia's cities, regional centres and rural communities. From the city to the bush, it is more important than ever that we get our infrastructure priorities and planning right. Every dollar spent by the federal government must have strong justification. We must demonstrate the economic benefit of investing in major infrastructure projects and not repeat the mistakes of the former Labor government, which saw little return relative to financial outlay. As the Deputy Prime Minister said in his second reading speech, we are focused on long-term planning based on robust evidence based findings and a greater understanding of the critical issues facing Australia's infrastructure and land transport system. Moreover, it is crucial that the Commonwealth work in partnership with business, industry and the states and territories to deliver quality infrastructure projects based upon transparency and reliable, independent advice. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to delivering the infrastructure of the 21st century, we are also ensuring that we have a strong, independent, transparent and expert advisory body when it comes to prioritising and determining new projects. The government has been quick to put in place a robust framework to deliver our historic $50 billion infrastructure plan. The Infrastructure Australia Bill 2013 sought to implement our commitment to ensure projects with a value of $100 million or more be considered by Infrastructure Australia, the intent being to give the public confidence that the government is investing in the right projects at the right time. Unfortunately, the amendments moved in the Senate removed this condition from the eventual legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before the House will amend the Infrastructure Australia Act 2008 to clarify the legislative and administrative arrangements for Infrastructure Australia. In addition to the measures contained in this bill, new governance measures for Infrastructure Australia came into effect on 1 September 2014. These new measures will see Infrastructure Australia better able to demonstrate transparency and thorough analysis when prioritising projects and providing advice to government. Infrastructure Australia is implementing the key priorities tasked to it by this government, including the undertaking of an audit of nationally significant infrastructure, the development of a 15-year plan on infrastructure priorities, and the assessment of projects receiving government funding of $100 million or more. While such assessments have been the practice previously, the requirement for them will now be guaranteed by law. Importantly, the amount of $100 million will be indexed to ensure that in future years the relative cost of significant infrastructure is maintained. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The last element—the assessment of projects receiving significant government funding—is crucial if we are to avoid the types of mistakes made by the former Labor government, such as with their rollout of the National Broadband Network. The NBN is a perfect example of poor governance. The largest infrastructure project Australia has seen for decades was cobbled together over 11 weeks. It appears that those driving the policy lacked the skills and knowledge to manage the intricacies of a nationwide telecommunications project. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was only when this government undertook a cost-benefit analysis that it became clear that the coalition's approach of using different technologies would deliver net benefits of approximately $18 billion in current dollars. Without that approach, the project would have been deemed unviable to continue. Labor's plan would have taken four years longer than originally advised, would have cost an additional $29 billion and would have resulted in an increase in consumer internet bills of approximately $43 a month. We are committed to delivering the NBN sooner, at lower cost to the taxpayer and, importantly, more affordably for consumers. This legislation will ensure that incidents like Labor's approach to the NBN rollout are never repeated. This legislation mandates that a project can only be listed in the Infrastructure Priority List if a cost-benefit analysis has been prepared.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Infrastructure Australia will also provide input and guidance on projects such as NorthConnex, which under this government is finally being delivered. I have been fighting for the M1-M2 NorthConnex link from the day that I became a candidate and have continued the fight for it as the member for Dobell. NorthConnex will not only benefit the people of the Central Coast and north-west Sydney, but it will have a flow-on effect across New South Wales. As a nine kilometre tunnel motorway linking the M1 and M2 motorways, NorthConnex will ease traffic congestion, particularly along Pennant Hills Road. It will enable commuters and freight vehicles to bypass up to 21 traffic lights, reducing travel time by up to 15 minutes. NorthConnex delivers more than just reduced travel times; it also delivers investment and jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The major challenge on the Central Coast is the creation of local job opportunities to match labour-force demand. The New South Wales Central Coast is expected to grow by an additional 100,000 people by 2031, requiring more than 45,000 new jobs. For the people of Dobell who commute outside the region, not only will NorthConnex provide shorter and safer travelling options, less time in traffic and more time with their families but it will also provide job opportunities that to date have been unfeasible and unachievable prior to this government's infrastructure investment. We know this because we have undertaken a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis on this project. Substantial infrastructure projects such as NorthConnex are vital in developing a stronger and more prosperous economy to enable us to be more competitive, to be more productive and to raise our standard of living.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to NorthConnex, this government is also delivering the M1 Productivity Package, which will see the widening of the M1 to six lanes between the Tuggerah and Doyalson interchanges. These measures will make life for commuter easier and increase the productivity of companies reliant on the Ml to deliver goods and services, as well as making the journey safer for their drivers. Locally, we are delivering long-overdue upgrades to roads, sporting facilities and aquatic infrastructure to unlock the Central Coast's tourism capabilities. Dobell will benefit from this government's commitment to build the infrastructure of the 21st century with $8.55 million for local infrastructure projects. Importantly, this investment enhances our local economy, drives job growth and encourages greater investment in our region. This government is working closely with local government to deliver vital upgrades to local roads.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the election, I have been engaging with my local community. I have been asking them to identify their biggest local issues and overwhelmingly the response has been about substandard local roads. By virtue of rate pegging in New South Wales, we have seen local government struggle to keep pace with the need to upgrade local roads. During the current financial year, the federal government will provide over $23 million to Central Coast local councils, which is to be spent on local priorities. High on this list is the upgrade and renewal of our local roads system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As identified in our growth plan for the Central Coast, the importance of improving local transport connections is critical to accommodating Dobell's strong population growth. This provides the community with access to employment, facilities and services. In addition to the general grants provided to Wyong and Gosford's local councils, we are investing a further $2.75 million to enhance the safety and quality of local roads. This investment will afford motorists with safer access to and from the growth suburbs of Lisarow and Ourimbah by upgrading the Ridgeway and the lake-side suburbs of Tuggerawong and Wyongah via the Jensen Road upgrade. These upgrades are long overdue. Without the financial assistance of the federal government, it would be difficult for local government to allocate the necessary funds from their restricted revenue pool.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also building safer roads through our record $500 million investment in the national Black Spot Program. Under this program, Dobell has been allocated $1.4 million to upgrade dangerous black spots in Toukley, Berkeley Vale, Charmhaven and Holgate. Upgrades to these roads will help save lives and reduce road trauma, ensuring our local roads are safer for motorists, cyclists and pedestrians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's record-breaking infrastructure investment extends beyond roads. In Dobell, we are also seeing the sea infrastructure of the 21st century underway. The Norah Head boat ramp is Dobell's only sea-access boat ramp. The boat ramp plays a vital role in supporting our tourist and fishing economy by drawing locals and visitors alike to our magnificent beaches and coastline. Our $700,000 investment has enabled Wyong Shire Council to commence necessary repair work on this $3.25 million project, with completion due early 2015.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am also pleased to say that work is progressing on the Tuggerah Sporting Precinct. This project was included in our growth plan for the Central Coast because this is a project that will not only deliver state-of-the-art sporting facilities but also important economic benefits to the Central Coast through increased sports, tourism and, importantly, more jobs. Historically dependent on manufacturing and tourism, our region has felt the pinch of tightening economic conditions and the increasing affordability of international travel.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we have much to be proud off. We offer a beautiful natural  environment, crowned by Tuggerah Lakes, which attracts tourists over the summer months. But our challenge is to generate year-round tourism, which will sustain local business operator outside of the summer months. This challenge can be addressed through growing our sports tourism economy. I want to see Dobell become the choice destination for state and national sporting competitions. Our investment in the Tuggerah Sporting Precinct will enable the hosting of regional and national sports events on the Central Coast. I will continue to support this proposal and the advancement of sports tourism on the Central Coast, as it is critical to our region's prosperity and a catalyst for employment opportunities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When this bill talks of the rigour of its prioritisation of projects, the proposed Central Coast regional airport comes to mind. The New South Wales Central Coast is one of the eighth largest regions in Australia, yet we are the only one not serviced by a regional airport. This government is working alongside local and state governments to guide necessary regulatory and planning issues, whilst demonstrating transparency and a coordinated approach across the jurisdictions. While the first flight from a Central Coast regional airport is some years away, this project will drive investment, deliver new infrastructure, create jobs and have a positive impact on the Central Coast economy. Sitting within the major transport corridor of the M1 Pacific Motorway and the Northern Rail line, this aviation infrastructure will act as a magnet for industry to establish and invest on the Central Coast. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank the Deputy Prime Minister, the Honourable Warren Truss, and the Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, the Honourable Jamie Briggs, for their support and commitment to the Central Coast region. I am proud to be part of the Abbott infrastructure team, which is addressing the needs of communities across Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is delivering significant infrastructure projects nationwide and to the people of Dobell. Broadening the reform agenda and actively collaborating transparently with stakeholders can only improve economic growth. Under the infrastructure Prime Minister, we are seeing investment in projects that will leave our communities—including the New South Wales Central Coast community—better off in a variety of ways. By creating safer roads, improving access to tourism, supporting infrastructure, and commencing long-term planning and investment in improving a major transport node, we are doing what we were elected to do; we are delivering. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There will always be more work to be done. This bill will ensure that when the federal government commits to a major infrastructure project it will be assessed and delivered against robust criteria including value for money and, importantly, the best interest of our nation and our communities. I look forward to continuing to deliver the infrastructure of the 21st century to Dobell. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the 2013 election, the then opposition leader, Tony Abbott, made the following promise:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There'll be cranes over our cities and bulldozers working on big infrastructure projects such as WestConnex in Sydney and the East West Link in Melbourne that will be under way within 12 months of a change of government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I live in a community through which the proposed WestConnex freeway will come. The WestConnex will come through the electorate of Kingsford Smith, but do we see any cranes in the sky associated with WestConnex? Of course not. Do we see any bulldozers on the ground working on this project? Not at all. Another broken election commitment from this Abbott government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The facts are that, despite bold statements, the Abbott government has failed to begin work on a single new major project that was not conceived, approved or funded under the previous Labor government. It was Labor that put in place the infrastructure projects that this Abbott government is now out around Australia claiming as their own—hypocrisy writ large when it comes to infrastructure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I accept that it is probably entirely reasonable that a new government would not have major infrastructure projects up and running within a period of one year of being elected. That is particularly reasonable if such a government were to undertake proper cost-benefit analyses of projects and undertake robust planning and assessment of those projects. The issue that we have with this government on a number of policy areas, including infrastructure, is why would you make the commitment to the Australian people that you are going to have major projects, such as WestConnex, up and running within 12 months? Why would you say that? Why would you mislead the public, march them down the garden path and offer up the proverbial sandwich when it comes to infrastructure? It is misleading to the Australian public, and it amounts to a resounding failure by this government to do what it intended to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That failure was recently highlighted for all to see when the Deputy Prime Minister, Warren Truss, responded to a question in this chamber about whether he could name any project funded by the coalition that had started construction within the last 12 months consistent with the commitment that was made by the Prime Minister. He pointed to five projects, including Melbourne's East West Link and Sydney's WestConnex road project. The problem is that every single one of those projects had originally been funded by the former Labor government or was still in the planning stage.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In furtherance of their illusive approach, the government has handed $2 billion to the New South Wales government for the WestConnex and $1.5 billion to the Victorian government for its East West Link. Neither of these projects has been subject to a proper cost-benefit analysis prior to the payments being made, yet proper cost-benefit analysis was what this government promised in its <span style="font-style:italic;">Our Plan</span><span style="font-style:italic;">: </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Real Solutions for all Australians </span>pamphlet prior to the last election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The WestConnex project is an important infrastructure project, despite the fact that it has not been subject to cost-benefit analysis. The project comes through the electorate of Kingsford Smith. In our community, we are also subject to freight and increasing truck movements from Australia's largest seaport. The busiest seaport in this country is Port Botany in our community of Kingsford Smith. Two million containers a year are moved at that dock. Since the O'Farrell government privatised Port Botany, the cap on container movements of 3.2 million containers has been removed. That is going to mean a massive increase in the number of trucks on our local roads. The number of big trucks—which damage the road, are quite noisy, and disrupt families who are living beside the port—is going to increase by a large magnitude when this port gets up and running to its full capacity. Here we have the busiest port in the country and a brand-new road construction project that goes right past the port. Does the road link up with the port under the current proposal? No, not at all. It does not link up with the largest port in Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This has not gone unnoticed. The Australian Logistics Council, which represent the country's biggest trucking and transport firms, have raised concerns about the failure of Port Botany to connect up with the WestConnex project. They say that it undermines the economic potential benefits of the project, and they are exactly right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a recent speech, the chief executive, Michael Kilgariff, highlighted the industry's concern that WestConnex 'does not actually go to Port Botany'. An advance copy of the speech provided to Fairfax Media states: 'In fact, it will completely bypass the port, and the port precinct, by some distance to the port's east. I appreciate that there are some significant logistical issues having the motorway run via the port, not to mention the cost of connecting the road to the port, but it is disappointing from a freight efficiency perspective that the motorway did not run further into the port area.' I could not agree with him more. This is the point about proper cost-benefit analysis and it is the crux of the bill we are debating in the chamber this evening. If there is a proper cost-benefit analysis of this project you would have to argue that it must connect with Australia's busiest container port to maximise the economic benefits. Unfortunately, that has not occurred under this government, despite the promises of a proper cost-benefit analysis. That is why this bill requires amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition's attempt to legislate for a cost-benefit analysis of major infrastructure projects, particularly WestConnex, comes too late. This bill means that a cost-benefit analysis of projects worth more than $100 million will occur after the allocation of funding, not before. Again, this is highlighted by the deficiency in the WestConnex project. As the shadow minister, Anthony Albanese, has said, 'Commonwealth funds should be invested in projects with the greatest capacity to enhance the nation's productivity.' That is a point that the Australian Logistics Council agreed with when they were making the point about WestConnex not linking up with Port Botany. The government should listen to what the shadow minister says. They should listen because he is right. Right now we are witnessing a re-hash of Howard-era pork-barrelling when it comes to an infrastructure priority list.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of the wrong priority list, one which puts the Liberal Party's interests well before Australia's interests, we see an Abbott government whose first act was to cut billions from public transport projects identified by Infrastructure Australia as the most efficient investments. So not only do we get the Howard-era, non-productive priority list; we get the Howard-era under-investment in our nation's infrastructure. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Infrastructure Australia Amendment (Cost Benefit Analysis and Other Measures) Bill 2014 seeks to undertake prior cost-benefit analysis of major infrastructure projects—over $100 million—and to make other changes to the structure and operation of the act. Labor supports an independent and transparent Infrastructure Australia. That is why we created it in 2008—to take the politics out of decisions related to where particularly federal funds should be invested in infrastructure to improve the economic and productive capacity of the nation. We supported the amendments moved by the transport minister in June to retain IA's independence. These amendments are now part of the act. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill shows that the government just does not understand the process of proper project selection. Proper process requires IA to rank projects by relevant subjective criteria prior to a government decision on which projects to fund. Labor will move an amendment to relate the $100 million to the capital value of a project rather than to the level of Commonwealth funding. The opposition's amendment will actually fulfil the coalition's own election commitment.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You will note that it says projects with a value of more than $100 million, not projects where the government contributes $100 million. That is a very important distinction. The proper process is to assess first, then fund later—not the other way around. This assess first, fund later sequence aligns with Labor's already legislated process for the Building Australia Fund. In fact, it is law. Sections 64 and 116 of the Nation-building Funds Act outline that that is the manner in which assessments should take place. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flynn</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:52</span>):  I am pleased to be here tonight to speak on the Infrastructure Australia Amendment (Cost Benefit Analysis and Other Measures) Bill 2014. Prior to the election, we in the coalition said we would ensure that Infrastructure Australia would be: (1) a strong, independent and transparent expert advisory body; and (2) able to deliver quality independent advice on infrastructure proposals. This government believe that a function of Infrastructure Australia should be to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of nationally significant infrastructure projects which receive significant Commonwealth funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of this bill is to deliver on the coalition's election promise to strengthen the role of Infrastructure Australia and to create a more transparent, accountable and effective adviser on infrastructure projects and policies. We remain committed to broadening the current infrastructure reform agenda in collaboration with jurisdictions and industry to improve productivity and drive economic growth. The bill will amend the Infrastructure Australia Act 2008 to include the requirement that Infrastructure Australia undertakes evaluations of proposals for infrastructure projects which are of national significance and that involve Commonwealth funding of at least $100 million and ensures that cost-benefit analyses inform the evaluation of the proposals. The passing of the bill will bring into effect an important coalition election commitment to: ensure better infrastructure planning; ensure more rigorous and transparent assessments of taxpayer funded projects; and develop a much firmer and clearer infrastructure plan for Australia's future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the coalition's policy to deliver infrastructure into the 21st century, we committed to ensure that every project with a Commonwealth contribution of more than $100 million, apart from Defence projects, undergoes Infrastructure Australia's robust scrutiny and analysis. These projects might include dams, telecommunications, hospitals, educational institutions, energy projects or water networks. The coalition government have already tasked Infrastructure Australia with some key priorities, including: assessing projects receiving government funding of over $100 million; undertaking an audit of nationally significant infrastructure; and developing a 15-year plan on infrastructure priorities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In November 2013 the government introduced the Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013 to make Infrastructure Australia an independent governing entity. It is now a truly independent truly independent advisory body, with a CEO responsible to a board. It has been given a mandate to identify Australia's long-term infrastructure needs for a rolling 15-year plan to be updated every five years and to get ahead of political decision making by assessing projects before choices are made and announced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government is committed to building the infrastructure of the 21st century to ensure Australia can meet future transport challenges. In the 2014-15 budget, we laid out a historic $50 billion infrastructure investment program to deliver vital transport infrastructure across regional centres and rural communities, as well as our cities. Treasury analysis confirms that investments will also leverage more than $125 billion in the new infrastructure investment. This commitment is part of an economic action strategy to build a strong, prosperous economy, boost productivity and create thousands of new jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Previous governments left my electorate of Flynn with a huge infrastructure backlog, but this government is moving swiftly to see projects accelerated and completed. You need look no further than the Queensland national highways. This government is well on its way to fixing the Bruce Highway. It was identified by the Productivity Commission early this year that previous decisions were made without proper cost analysis. Just look at the NBN, as an example. In Flynn, there is still much to do, and I have no doubt that this will be confirmed by a robust cost-benefit analysis of proposed projects. The Dawson Highway between Biloela and Gladstone has long been neglected and is in urgent need of investment. This is the heart of the Central Queensland cattle country. Would you believe that in the space of 120 kilometres there are five bridges that have load limit restrictions and B-doubles cannot even use this road? We need these roads to take B-double weights to transport our cattle around.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Investment would open up opportunities for direct export of agricultural and other products through the Port of Gladstone, which is currently underutilised and was previously used as a coal port only. Other roads and transport corridors that need urgent attention to facilitate cost-effective investments in agriculture and industry include: the Springsure-Tambo road—I get plenty of complaints about the condition of that road—the Rolleston-Blackwater road and the Bauhinia Downs-Woorabinda road.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CHESTERS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:04</span>):  I support the Infrastructure Australia Amendment (Cost Benefit Analysis and Other Measures) Bill 2014. The amendments in the bill seek to restore the independence and transparency of Infrastructure Australia. This is not the first time I have had the opportunity to speak on this bill in this parliament. On several occasions people on this side of the House have tried to get the government to restore the independence and transparency of Infrastructure Australia. Infrastructure Australia was created in 2008 to ensure that projects were based upon need, based upon the country's priorities, and not based upon political opportunism. There is no greater example of that than in Victoria, where the funding for a massive project—the East West Link—has been put ahead of everything else. Funding of about $8 billion from state Liberal and National and federal Liberal and National governments is going towards a tunnel that will not solve Melbourne's transport problems. That is funding that could have gone towards our regional road and rail infrastructure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before the House demonstrates the stunning failure of this government to ensure proper process with project selection, and it also ensures there is a cost-benefit analysis for any project that the Commonwealth funds. Proper process requires Infrastructure Australia to rank projects in order of need and priority. It links the need for a cost-benefit analysis to Commonwealth funding—the project must pass the cost-benefit test before it receives funding. This government has allocated funding first when it comes to the East West Link and discussion about the cost-benefit analysis has taken place second. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor will move an amendment to relate analysis to a $100 million capital value of a project rather than a level of Commonwealth funding. This is important because we need to consider the project as a whole. It is important that within the proper process we assess first and fund later. That is how we ensure that we are getting best value for the taxpayer's dollar and that we are addressing projects in order of need and critical importance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Linking the cost-benefit analysis to the commitment of Commonwealth funding means that public transport projects will also be prioritised. As we have heard from this government on several occasions, they do not believe it is their responsibility to fund the public transport networks. This is just such a cynical view of how our country functions. Our country needs to ensure that we have funding and investment in both public transport and road usage. The best outcome for our country is a combination of good roads and good rail to ensure that people can get safely to where they want to go and also to ensure that our product and services can get from A to B in the safest and fastest way possible. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I have mentioned, the greatest example of why these amendments are so necessary is the East West Link in Melbourne. We know that the Liberals, whether they be state or federal, are obsessed with Melbourne based transport road projects, leaving behind the importance of suspending funding on our regional roads and regional rail. At a state level, the Liberal-National government are spending $8 billion, which includes some advanced federal funding allocated to them for the East West tunnel, leaving precious little funding available for vital regional rail projects. Yes, they have put a couple of million dollars into this project or a couple of million dollars into that project, but it goes nowhere near the $8 billion investment that is going into the East West tunnel. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us just remind people about this tunnel. There are very few people in Melbourne who actually travel from east to west in the inner city. There is very little product on that side of Melbourne that needs to go from east to west. The biggest solution to the traffic problem in East Melbourne is a rail link to get the people living in the east into the city. The reason why it is a tunnel that goes nowhere is that people end up in exactly the same traffic queue once they turn off to try to get into the city. The East West Link tunnel is a classic example of the government not wanting to do a cost-benefit analysis. They did not want to see the business case for the tunnel; it was about appeasing voters in the east. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This project demonstrates why it is so important that Infrastructure Australia maintains its independence and transparency and that it continues to play the role of prioritising infrastructure projects in Australia. Instead of allocating funds to our regional highways, arterial roads, local roads and regional roads, they are being allocated to what has been described by many as the 'dud tunnel'. This tunnel, as we know, is also going to displace a number of people who are currently living in the area. It has been a rushed project that has caused great concern within the community. If there had been a process whereby stakeholders had been able to engage before the maps of the tunnel had been released, we could have avoided the conflict that is going on right now in Melbourne around this project. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Wasting money is what nobody wants. It is the federal government who needs to take responsibility for strong cost-benefit analyses of projects on behalf of the Australian people. The Prime Minister does not believe that it is the role of the government to do this. Last September in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Age </span>he said that he did not see the need for the East West Link business case. The journalist went on to report in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Age </span>that the government will hand over $1.5 billion in funding for the tunnel, without seeing the full business case. This is from a government that claims to be economic marvels and rationalists! They hand over $1.5 billion in funding for a tunnel that has not had a cost-benefit analysis done on it and that will not solve the problems of Melbourne. They hand over funding without seeing the business case. Now the government is making an advanced payment to the state of Victoria to help fast-track the project. For those who do not know, there is a state election in Victoria. So this is another case of pork-barrelling and another reason why we need to see an independent, transparent Infrastructure Australia that can put forward the priority list for our country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Good roads and rail are critical to regional communities, and this funding of the East West Link could have gone to our region. Take Mildura, where we have a freight rail. It has become so degraded that freight is leaving Mildura at less than 15 kilometres per hour. The whole of regional Victoria whether in the east, north, north-west, north-east or west, there is product we are trying to get to port. That is why it is so critical to invest in the roads and rail infrastructure in our region. This $8 billion could have actually helped get that product to port safely. When we talk about roads in our region, the Calder Alternate Highway going north of Bendigo is a hazard. There have been number of accidents on that road already this year. If the government were serious about getting value for money, if the government were serious about supporting and growing our agricultural industry, they would invest in the roads and infrastructure that would help get our product to port. That is not an east-west link tunnel. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The only major infrastructure project that will benefit Central Victoria is the Regional Rail Link, and that was funded by the former federal-state Labor governments. To be honest, the state Liberal-National government had to be dragged to this project kicking and screaming. It is also a good example of why we need Infrastructure Australia. It is an example of a project that did have a strong business case, that did have a strong cost-benefit analysis and that was a priority for the region. The former federal Labor government partnered with the former state Labor government and invested $4.4 billion in building the Regional Rail Link—the largest Commonwealth investment in urban public transport in Australia's history. Why I say 'urban' is that it provided a direct line. So once the freight and passenger rail got to the outer suburbs of Melbourne, it had a direct link into the city and did not get stuck behind the metro traffic. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the biggest rail project in over 80 years, and it is the first rail project in Victoria in 80 years. It took Labor governments at state and federal level to realise that. It was through the prioritisation of a body like Infrastructure Australia that it was made to happen. When completed, the Regional Rail Link will provide a capacity for an extra 23 Metro peak services each morning and evening thus allowing more Victorians to have sustainable transport. So this one regional rail link does not just help regional travellers; it does not just help regional product to get to port; it also helps Metro because it frees up the Metro lines to allow Metro travel. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Congestion is the handbrake on the economy, and currently it is costing the Australian economy $13 billion. It is something that every speaker recognises. The question is: how do we tackle that? How do we ensure that we have the infrastructure priority list to make sure that as a country we are tackling this issue? These decisions cannot be done by pork-barrelling or election spins or election cycles. These decisions must be prioritised by an independent Infrastructure Australia where we have a cost benefit analysis and a business case. It is how you get projects like the Regional Rail Link off the ground as opposed to the east-west tunnel that we are currently facing in Victoria. The Commonwealth government should be investing in an integrated transport system that combines both road and rail. The federal government does have a role to play in investing in rail, and to suggest that we do not is narrow-sighted. If we want to be able to get more people onto rail to free up our roads for freight, then we need to have federal government investment in rail.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also why we need the independent and transparent Infrastructure Australia. Among the other areas that need to be considered when it comes to these massive projects is, for example, procurement. The Regional Rail Link created a lot of jobs in Victoria. The construction space created 4,000 jobs and, because that tender process was done—started by the former Labor government and at a federal and state level—apprenticeships were created. Local jobs were created. There was procurement where small businesses and local businesses were able to tender for that work. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what we are seeing with the Regional Rail Link, and through some of the complaints that I have heard, is that if the tender process goes ahead great big consortia from around the world will tender for that project and local businesses are concerned that they will miss out on that work. Last week I visited Tylden Equipment in Kyneton. They build cement plants, and for a project like the East-West Link they would build the cement plant that makes the cement for the tunnel. They are worried that because they are further down the supply chain and because the project could go to a major international consortium that could bring over the cement plant and put it together here at the site, Tylden would lose that opportunity to build the cement plant for the project. That particular place employs 20 employees and a contract to build the cement plant for the East-West Link would secure work for that facility for at least six months. So when we talk about major projects, we need to consider procurement and ensuring that through the supply chain contracts are going to local providers if they are able to provide those services. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is about ensuring that we restore independence and transparency to Infrastructure Australia. It is about ensuring that Australia gets the projects and the transport routes it needs in the order it needs them. It takes away the pork-barrelling that we have seen in the past. It ensures that regardless of who is in those seats or regardless of the political party we are building the infrastructure that we need for the future. As I have said, at the moment regional Victoria is being dudded by this government and is not getting its fair share of funding from this government when it comes to building the major regional road and rail infrastructure it requires.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:19</span>):  I am very pleased to rise to speak on the Infrastructure Australia Amendment (Cost Benefit Analysis and Other Measures) Bill 2014. This is an important bill which will provide clarity about the role of Infrastructure Australia and ensure that cost benefit analyses are entrenched under the Infrastructure Australia Act. It will implement the government's promise made at the 2013 election that Infrastructure Australia will assess projects with a capital expenditure amount of $100 million or more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time available to me today I would like to make three points, firstly, that the policies of the previous government, the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government, in relation to Infrastructure Australia involved some sensible aspirations, aspirations that sadly were not reflected in reality. Secondly, I want to argue that the saga of the national broadband network is a good example of why it is so important to have a cost benefit analysis before a major infrastructure project. Thirdly, I want to highlight that the measures in this bill will entrench the role of cost benefit analyses in the process overseen by Infrastructure Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning to the first point, the previous government stated some high-minded aspirations in relation to Infrastructure Australia and the way that it would work. Infrastructure Australia was announced by Kevin Rudd in 2008 and at the time it was said that this new statutory body was to have three key objectives: to conduct audits on all aspects of nationally significant infrastructure, in particular water, transport, communications and energy; to draw up an infrastructure priority list involving billions of dollars of planned projects; and to advise government, investors and infrastructure developers on regulatory reform aimed at speeding up projects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A key principle articulated by Infrastructure Australia in all of its materials was the importance of cost benefit analysis. Indeed, that principle was reflected in some of the things that were said more broadly by the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government. In the 2008-9 budget, the then government—from memory, at that stage it was only the Rudd government and was only later to achieve its full magnificence as the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government—stated that efficient public sector infrastructure investment required 'a commitment to transparency at all stages of the decision-making process'. Sadly, that high-minded aspiration was not lived up to and within the following year the then government failed to release the cost-benefit analysis of the 15 projects with a total investment value of $80 billion that were selected for partial government funding in the 2009-10 budget. Six of these projects, in fact, were not on the priority list established by Infrastructure Australia. Even more troubling is that Labor decided that it would build a national broadband network, a network whose culmination we now know—based upon analysis conducted by NBN Co and released publicly just before Christmas last year—would have involved an expenditure of well over $70 billion, but there was no cost-benefit analysis. And yet Infrastructure Australia issued guidelines which articulated its stated principle of the primacy of cost-benefit analysis. Infrastructure Australia said it:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… will only give advice to governments—often in relation to hundreds of millions of dollars of public funds—on the basis of a comprehensive and robust evidence base.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time, throughout the time of the previous government, there was in place the provisions of the best practice regulation handbook, which said that the Australian government is committed to 'the use of cost-benefit analysis to assess regulatory proposals to encourage better decision making'.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Cost-benefit analysis is important for a host of reasons. We know that, sadly, there are always more calls on government funding than government is able to meet. Therefore, there is a need to prioritise the projects which government is considering funding. Clearly, a rational basis on which to prioritise funding is to have regard to a formal analysis of the likely benefit to be delivered by the project and weigh that up against the likely cost of the project. This is summarised, of course, in the notion of the benefit-cost ratio. It is very important to measure the costs and benefits of different policy options, including, of course, indirect costs or benefits such as gains accruing to the community rather than to individuals—that is to say, public gains rather than private gains—on a common basis so that these costs and benefits can be fairly compared. Unfortunately, the previous Labor government—the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government—failed to live up to its bold claims and stated aspirations in relation to both Infrastructure Australia and the cost-benefit analysis as a principle. Despite the bold rhetoric, the profligate spending of the previous government meant that it was soon the case that Infrastructure Australia was not in a position to make recommendations which were supported by funding commitments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a very stark contrast with the clear commitment that the Abbott government has made in relation to infrastructure as part of the 2014-15 budget, where there was laid out a historic $50 billion infrastructure investment program designed to deliver vital transport infrastructure right across our cities, regional centres and rural communities. First of all, Infrastructure Australia failed to live up to aspirations because it became increasingly irrelevant as it became obvious that the federal government had spent all of its money and more. Secondly, it failed to live up to the stated aspiration of using a cost-benefit analysis as a key requirement before any major project.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me turn to the National Broadband Network as a case study of why it is so important to have a cost-benefit analysis and why, sadly, the previous government failed to live up to that principle. In 2009, the then Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, announced that the government was going to invest up to $43 billion together with the private sector over eight years in a super-fast national broadband network which he described as 'the single biggest infrastructure decision in Australia's history'. Some 15 minutes after the press conference, Mr Rudd updated his Twitter account and said: 'Just announced biggest ever investment in Australian broadband, really exciting infrastructure for the future.' There was no mention of cost-benefit analysis in that tweet. The then communications minister, Senator Conroy, said that the decision was a historic moment for Australia's telecommunications sector. But with this announcement and with the very big commitment of spending there was no cost-benefit analysis, despite the stated policy of the than Labor government that there would be a cost-benefit analysis conducted through the Infrastructure Australia process before major infrastructure commitments. Indeed, then broadband and communication minister Conroy repeatedly dismissed calls for a cost-benefit analysis. In May 2009, he had this to say:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We do not need any more studies, any more cost-benefit analysis, to know that this is an infrastructure investment that this country is crying out for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When in opposition, the coalition sought to help—we sought to assist. We proposed legislation designed to remind the then government of its commitments and designed to require the Productivity Commission to conduct and publish a cost-benefit analysis of the National Broadband Network. Sadly, that legislation was not supported by the then government. As late as 2013, the then Prime Minister—back for a second time—Mr Rudd, was still boasting about the National Broadband Network and glossing over the lack of a cost-benefit analysis. In his speech to the Urban Development Institute of Australia Congress in 2013, he said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the Government has undertaken the single biggest capital investment program in the country's history in the NBN to turbo charge productivity growth for the future by providing businesses with new technology platforms …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the coalition came to government, we acted, consistent with our policy commitment, to rectify this yawning gap and we established a process to carry out a cost-benefit analysis. Before we did that, Mr Bill Scales AO, a very eminent public servant and a significant contributor to public policy in Australia over many decades, was commissioned to conduct an independent audit of NBN policy process, and he had this to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There was no business case or any cost-benefit analysis, or independent studies of the policy undertaken, with no clear operating instructions provided to this completely new government business enterprise, within a legislative and regulatory framework still undefined, and without any consultation with the wider community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is about as damning a summary of a chaotically mismanaged public policy process as you could imagine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have sought to correct this yawning gap. Last month the government released the independent cost-benefit analysis of the National Broadband Network, a piece of work done by an eminent committee chaired by Dr Vertigan, again an eminent former public servant. That piece of work assessed the costs and benefits of deploying broadband through a range of models. It confirmed that there are economic and social advantages in deploying high-speed broadband infrastructure. Indeed, it found that nationwide access to superfast broadband will deliver total benefits to Australia worth more than $40 billion in today's dollars. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Very importantly, it considered the preferences and potential future demand for high-speed broadband in Australia and it estimated consumer willingness to pay for increased broadband speeds—an absolutely critical part of the analysis and something that the previous government never bothered to do. The report found that consumers do not need and are not willing to pay for speeds greater than those that will be available under the Abbott government's commitment of 50 megabits per second by the end of 2019 to 90 per cent of the fixed line footprint.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cost-benefit analysis that was conducted under the auspices of the current government also concluded that the present government's approach to deploying the National Broadband Network through an optimised multitechnology mix model, as recommended in the strategic review conducted by NBN Co, will provide net benefits of $18 billion compared to a baseline in which there is no further rollout of superfast broadband. Indeed, one of the particular merits of the cost-benefit analysis conducted by the Vertigan panel was to systematically assess the various paths forward from the starting point and say: what are the options, what are the costs of each of those paths and what are the benefits that will be captured if we choose one or other of these paths? I am pleased to say that it found that the multitechnology mix model, which is the one that the current government is now pursuing in relation to the National Broadband Network, is one that will offer $16 billion more in net benefits than the fibre-to-the-premises plan that the previous Labor government was following. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, the cost-benefit analysis found that the previous Labor government's plan would have had net benefits of only about $2 billion. There is a very clear reason for this. The multitechnology mix model will deliver broadband to most Australian households considerably more quickly than the plan which the previous government was following and people get benefit from getting the broadband network delivered more quickly. So it was a thorough and rigorous analysis that looked at the costs and the benefits. It was a very important approach and one that is delivering tangible public policy benefits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third point I want to make in the brief time available is that the bill before the House will entrench the requirement to carry out a cost-benefit analysis and, as the experience with the National Broadband Network shows, this is a very desirable thing. The lack of such a step being taken by the previous government has been highly regrettable in that it has led to delays and it has led to a path being followed which was not the optimal path, a path that needed to be corrected by the present government. I am pleased to say we are getting on with correcting it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is uncontentious that investing in infrastructure is of the highest importance, but there are finite funds available to government so to allocate those funds rationally it is very important to engage in cost-benefit analysis. That is what this bill will ensure happens.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:34</span>):  It is deeply ironic in this debate on the Infrastructure Australia Amendment (Cost Benefit Analysis and Other Measures) Bill 2014 that we should get a lecture from government members opposite about the virtues of independent cost-benefit analysis for major projects when in my own area they are running a mile from undertaking one for the East West Link in Melbourne—that is, the freeway through Royal Park. I wrote to the Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development and his parliamentary secretary on 27 August seeking appropriate and publicly transparent economic modelling, environmental assessment and community consultation before we get tens of billions of dollars spent on a tunnel that makes no economic sense, will damage our environment and will hurt local communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government has spent $1.5 billion for both stage 1 and stage 2 of the East West Link project to connect the Eastern Freeway to CityLink with the idea of connecting the link to Melbourne's western ring road and western suburbs. Both these stages are reported to cost between $8 billion and $10 billion. These are huge sums of taxpayers' money that ought to be carefully considered in the context of the need for governments to live within their means. We often hear from those opposite about the need for government to live within its means. We constantly get lectured about fiscal responsibility. One would expect that a carefully thought out economic analysis would have been undertaken and released to verify the need for the East West tunnel project and the need for large sums of taxpayers' money; however, this is not the case.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Media reports based on FOI and leaked information have indicated that such economic modelling that has been carried out has been based on false assumptions regarding petrol prices, incomes, car running costs and inner-city parking. Against that background, I welcome and congratulate the Victorian Labor opposition leader, Daniel Andrews, for his leadership on infrastructure issues. Back on 11 September he stated that the forthcoming election in November in Victoria will be a choice of either better public transport and local roads or the $8 billion dud East West Link road tunnel.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Victorian Labor has obtained legal advice which states that any contract that is signed before an election for a project that is facing a Supreme Court challenge cannot be entered into safely. That legal advice was obtained by former Federal Court judge Ray Finkelstein, administrative law expert Richard Niall QC and contract law expert Siobhan Keating. Victorian Labor states that it will not be held responsible for a document that was recklessly devised in haste and error and that it does not believe that any contracts for the East West Link project can be validly entered into while a matter before the Supreme Court remains unresolved and there can be no certainty that any contracts for the East West Link are legally binding. Victorian Labor has said if no legally binding contracts exist, then a Victorian Labor government will not proceed with the East West Link project.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a disgrace that the Victorian Liberal Treasurer, Michael O'Brien, says the government is determined to sign the East West contracts before the onset of the pre-election caretaker period. I need to bring to the attention of the House that we need to recall that the Liberal Party said before the election that it would not build the East West Link. It did not take this issue to the voters. Now it is shamelessly trying to lock Victorian taxpayers into billions and billions of dollars on a freeway through Royal Park. This project is so big that it will eat up both Victoria's road budget and public transport budget for years. It kills off the legitimate aspirations of communities from all parts of Melbourne for improvements to their local roads, railway crossings and the like.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This fraud on the voters—trying to lock taxpayers into this lemon before an election can be held—comes from the same political party that talked up such a storm and became positively apoplectic over Julia Gillard's 'no carbon tax' pre-election statement. You have to wonder: where is that 'convoy of no confidence' when you need it? The East West tunnel project will cripple Victoria's finances for many years to come. It will crowd out the state's other core responsibilities in public transport, education and health. A proper, thorough and publicly transparent economic modelling case should be undertaken for this project. If we examine what is known in terms of economic analysis of the tunnel, then we can come to some understanding as to why this government is ducking and weaving to avoid undertaking one.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's business case relies totally on the assumption of what economists call an agglomeration effect in which population and economic clusters in cities lead to efficiencies and add to business productivity. The Linking Melbourne Authority, which provides information on road infrastructure projects conducted on behalf of the Victorian government, has referred to a book by the American writer Edward L Glaeser called <span style="font-style:italic;">Triumph of the City. </span>Its main thesis is the agglomeration benefits that create cities. The Linking Melbourne Authority does not appear to have read the book, because the book does not argue that freeways are the path to create these benefits. In fact, it argues quite the opposite. Mr Glaeser argues that 'driving creates negative externalities that hamper urban economies' and he warns against highway building, calling it 'anti-urban'. He said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The financial burden on the Victorian taxpayer will be so big that it will ''crowd out'' the state's core responsibilities for funding schools, hospitals, rail transport and even other roads for at least a generation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An email recently obtained through FOI illustrates that the Victorian government's own economic consultant, Chris Tehan of Evans and Peck, told the government that the business case 'had dramatically overestimated the wider economic benefits to get an artificial figure of a $1.40 return'. According to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Age</span>:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The financial case for the East West Link hinges on a prediction that toll road use will jump over the next 30 years because of rising wealth and shrinking petrol and CBD parking price rises. The business case makes the controversial assumption that: first, a driver's willingness to use toll roads will increase by 1.4 per cent per annum due to rising incomes; second, the rate of increase in the cost of running a car will fall from the current two per cent per annum in real terms to half a per cent per annum by 2041; and, third, that the rate of increase in the cost of inner city parking, which is currently increasing at four per cent per annum in real terms, will fall to 0.5 per cent by 2041. I personally regard this as a remarkably heroic assumption given that the state government has decided to extend its congestion levy up from the City of Melbourne into the City of Moreland, up into my electorate, in recent times. This will of course lead to significant increases to the cost of inner city parking.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Victorian government has been caught out manipulating modelling to produce a favourable result. The former Infrastructure Australia head Michael Deegan told a Senate committee that the government's unpublished business case provided an alternative estimate showing a cost-benefit ratio of just 0.8. Under this scenario, the project would return just 80c for every dollar spent, suggesting an economic loss if the stock standard analysis preferred by Infrastructure Australia is used. According to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Age</span>, in a submission to a federal infrastructure inquiry, Infrastructure Australia outed Victoria for failing to submit a robust business case for the East West Link, singling out:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Infrastructure Australia's 11-member council—which includes transport experts like Sir Rod Eddington and the former federal Treasury Secretary Martin Parkinson—is understood to broadly recommend only those projects with benefit-cost ratios of more than 1.5. And Michael Deegan warns that big-spending promises are being made without proper scrutiny. He said:</span>

The East West Link is forecast to carry 80,000 vehicles a day on opening in 2019, increasing to between 100,000 and 120,000 a day by 2031 according to this modelling. Stephen Pelosi said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">If it's reaching 120,000 we're at a position where we're reaching capacity. Unless you intervene in some manner and manage the toll rate to influence demand, you get a situation where you're near capacity.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If it is good enough for the NBN, as the previous speaker suggested to the House, it should be good enough for this project too. Why is the government only too happy to undertake economic modelling on the NBN yet, when it comes to the largest infrastructure and transport project in Victoria's history—East West Link—it refuses to do so. If the age of entitlement is over, why isn't the private sector bankrolling East West Link? If we are in the midst of a budget emergency, why aren't the belts being tightened when it comes to major projects that do not make economic sense?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why the amendments to the bill which Labor has moved seek to assess projects first on their merits and fund them later, not the other way around. We also seek to strengthen transparency and public disclosure of project assessments. These are strong measures that will prevent money being wasted on potential white elephants like the East West Link. If this government were serious about fiscal responsibility, if it were serious about merit based infrastructure planning then the freeway through Royal Park in Melbourne would not proceed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Concern with the lack of due diligence behind the decision to proceed with this freeway is growing. It is acknowledged in the transport industry that adding road capacity through the freeway will bring in more vehicles more quickly and actually worsen congestion on Haddle Street, Flemington Road, Tullamarine Freeway and other roads that are currently at capacity. Industry assessments are that the freeway will not fix congestion, because, as the 2008 Eddington report identified, less than 20 per cent of all vehicles travel through from the east to the west. What actually goes on is that 80 per cent of all vehicles exit to inner Melbourne to access jobs and services. They will continue to do that despite the Royal Park freeway and, with more vehicles reaching exits more quickly, the risk is that congestion will actually be worse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no strategic justification for this project. This is a proposal which fails critical productivity tests and runs the risk of being negative for state product and GDP. When a poor public project is selected, the community loses twice. It loses because scarce capital is misapplied and because taxes and funds raised to finance that project distort behaviour in ways which have a significant cost.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tolls on the planned freeway would have to be three times the current cost of an average trip on Citylink for the project's investors to make a profit, according to an international study led by University College London which analysed numerous transport megaprojects, including Australian road and rail projects. It found that, for investors to get a return on the freeway, motorists would have to be charged a minimum $10.50 to use it—and I assure that House that, if they are going to be charged $10.50, they will not be thanking this government or the Victorian government for that opportunity. Interestingly, we have seen the founder of Citylink, Alan Hale, saying as recently as 9 September that East West Link was the wrong priority for Victoria infrastructure. He said the 5.2-kilometre toll road is:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the wrong priority and will not alleviate congestion across the city…</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The evidence from cities around the world where real renewal has been achieved is that public transport should be the primary focus, not just more and more roads.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For those of us who have been involved in major transport projects long enough, the lessons learnt, often the hard way, are that building more roads without investing in public transport is simply a recipe for inducing more vehicular travel.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Alan Hale is absolutely right about that. There are superior alternatives to the East West Link, including those outlined by Victorian Labor: doubling the size of the Melbourne city loop, constructing the Melbourne Metro rail project or removing 50 of Victoria's most dangerous and bottlenecked level rail crossings. I commend the opposition's amendments to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:49</span>):  Madam Deputy Speaker Andrews, I congratulate you for your elevation to the chair. It is befitting that a fellow Queenslander is in the chamber today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise today to speak in support of the Infrastructure Australia Amendment (Cost Benefit Analysis and Other Measures) Bill 2014. The bill amends the Infrastructure Australia Act 2008 to clarify the legislation and administrative arrangements for Infrastructure Australia. It will enable a reordering of previsions pertaining to cost-benefit analyses of infrastructure proposals in the act to ensure that these analyses form the evaluation proposals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill makes provision for Infrastructure Australia to evaluate proposals involving Commonwealth funding of at least $100 million. I note that this involves a clarification and the bill is of an administrative nature not involving financial or regulatory impacts. In fact, Infrastructure Australia has already been tasked with acting on these new administrative arrangements. Bringing this bill before parliament and the Australian people is essentially about transparency and ensuring that all Australians are well informed about the changes that will impact on their lives. Most importantly, it is about ensuring that taxpayer dollars are well spent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Impacting Australian lives for the better is in itself quite meaningful when you look at the importance of well-directed infrastructure spending in Australia. Reliable and cutting-edge essential infrastructure is not only a defining feature of a prosperous and developed economy but is also not surprisingly a cornerstone of what the coalition government promised to deliver to Australians. I recall Prime Minister Tony Abbott's words upon being elected:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… we'll build the roads of the 21st century because I hope to be an infrastructure prime minister who puts bulldozers on the ground and cranes into our skies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister has been very busy making good on this promise ever since, with a staggering $50 billion of the Infrastructure Investment program committed in the May budget. That is a staggering $16.4 billion more than Labor promised. In fact, Labor not only promised less but took what it did have and used it for indiscriminate, undirected, even random infrastructure spending at enormous cost to the Australian taxpayer. At an Infrastructure Partnerships Australia address the Prime Minister made the extent of these indiscretions very clear when he said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… there has not been a single cost-benefit analysis published prior to any of this government's infrastructure commitments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He said, when he talking about the previous government:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Every single programme and project has gone ahead because it has suited the government's political agenda. Whether it actually met the long-term economic needs of our nation has never been the government's main concern. The result is an infrastructure spending gap that Infrastructure Partnerships Australia estimates would cost $800 billion over the next decade to fill. There is a better way. The Coalition has a plan for Australia's infrastructure of the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In stark contrast to Labor, we do have a better way. The coalition's $50 billion fund will be used to deliver vital transport infrastructure across our cities and our regional and rural centres, removing the black spots and ensuring that no Australian community will ever be forgotten and no Australian community will ever lag behind. Coming from the state of Queensland, I can speak from experience about what it means to be forgotten and to lag behind, because we have—and did have—some of the worst infrastructure in Australia. Given that the Bruce Highway singularly accounts for the worst record of deaths of any roads, we cannot afford any more neglect. The Bligh Labor government certainly did our state absolutely no favours in this regard. As Australia's second largest state, Queensland's economic wellbeing is very heavily dependent on infrastructure development. That is why Labor's appalling neglect just does not add up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Abbott government will bring back to life what should have been an intrinsic link between infrastructure and its development, and economic prosperity. We understand that better roads and rail networks deliver savings in key areas. They bring time savings; they make it easier to get freight around; they make it easier to move around our rural and regional cities; they bring cost savings, as travel times and, therefore, fuel costs are cut, so we can spend much less time travelling to and from work; and they bring life savings. With my state of Queensland being a case in point, the coalition's commitment of $6.7 billion, with a further 20 per cent being committed by the Queensland state government, may save up to 40 lives a year. That is a lot when you think that one death is too many and all deaths are unnecessary. Time savings are also likely to provide an incentive for safer driving practices in industries such as trucking, where a large amount of time is spent on roads. For many of us, improved vital infrastructure represents a better work-life balance. For others, it can mean all the difference in the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Investment in infrastructure is essential for our growth as a nation, with a population growth rate, according to the ABS census data from 2013, averaging 1.7 per cent, or close to 396,000, across Australia. If our investment in roads and other transport networks—the infrastructure today that Australians rely upon—fails to keep pace with this rapid population growth, it will negatively impact on our social and economic fabric. And that is just not the way that we as a nation want to be identified. Rather, we need to set before us the goal of being progressive and being as efficient a society as we can possibly be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is in this context that the Abbott government has brought this bill before the House, not as a legal necessity but as a government willing to show its hand and to keep all Australians well informed of the changes that impact on lives. The bill reflects the coalition's recognition that reliable and efficient infrastructure has an operational foundation. It involves sizeable projects, all three levels of government and a significant coordination requirement. Prior to the 2013 election, we indicated that we would create an expert advisory body, Infrastructure Australia, that was much stronger, much more independent and much more transparent. The vision for Infrastructure Australia was that it would be an expert advisory body and that it would facilitate effective coordination between industries, states and territories, particularly in prioritising and advising on infrastructure proposals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am really pleased to say today that Infrastructure Australia is truly—and, when I say truly, I do mean truly—an independent advisory body, with the CEO responsible to a board and a new chair, Mark Birrell. It will provide an assessment every five years on long-term infrastructure needs. It will inform budgetary and political processes well before it becomes critical for decisions to be made, and estimates will be indexed to ensure relativity. The Abbott government is well advanced in achieving these improvements on the operational efficiency for large infrastructure projects, having tasked Infrastructure Australia to assess projects—receiving government funding of $100 million or more. It will publish reports on its website as a transparent advice to government. It will audit nationally significant priorities. It will development a 15-year plan on infrastructure priorities, to be delivered in 2015, as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also noteworthy that work on the promised national infrastructure audit has been in consultation with state and territory governments—again consistent with our commitment to ensure coordinated responses to infrastructure needs. It is also noteworthy that Infrastructure Australia remains a key advisory body with an independent view. It is not a decision maker in terms of funding allocation. These decisions and these processes will remain the domain of the government of the day. Decisions will be the result of a publicly informed political process and, importantly, the result of a robust cost-benefit analysis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was only in recent times that we recoiled in absolute horror as our Minister for Communications, the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull, spelt out clearly for us the terrible price to be paid for the Labor Party's complete lack of regard for due diligence, particularly when it was dealing with the NBN project. He said, 'Labor is in denial about the NBN failures under its watch.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There must never again be a big government project undertaken without a cost-benefit analysis.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A big project without a cost benefit analysis—and the NBN could not get any bigger. A cost-benefit analysis for the NBN has finally been concluded and, after the fact, the results speak for themselves. Providing fast broadband to the bush through wireless and satellite services will cost nearly $5 billion but produce only $600 million in economic benefits—a return of just 10 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what is the use of a cost-benefit analysis now? This insidious piece of poor decision making and politicking has left us rolling out an expensive, inefficient network, which was a second-rate solution from its inception in the minds of a seemingly mindless opposition. Should Labor ever again see the light of day in government, we will certainly be ready to hold them to account, with an expectation that it will take a leaf out of our book and never again act with such contempt for the trust and the hopes of the people they are meant to responsibly represent. In Minister Turnbull's words:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The screamingly important message is: why wasn't a cost-benefit analysis done beforehand? There must never again be a big government project undertaken without a cost-benefit analysis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition now makes good on this promise. There will be no NBN style disasters on our watch. The Abbott government's good news story is that improved planning and advice will ensure infrastructure and therefore the standard of living of all Australians will be improved for decades to come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Improved coordination and prioritisation will eliminate the waste and duplication we have become accustomed to. Australians deserve to reap the benefits of taxpayers' dollars being well spent. We can ill afford the alternative—that is, costs that are borne by all Australians on numerous levels. I realise that there is no small change involved when we are dealing with infrastructure investment. But I believe I can rest my case in demonstrating that efficiently-allocated and well-prioritised infrastructure spending is beneficial for all Australians. This bill is about positioning Australia well into the 21st century as a growing and prosperous economy and I commend it to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also move provisions currently under 5B of the act relating to cost-benefit analysis to a new section, 5AA. The bill also provides that a proposal must not be included in an Infrastructure Priority List unless a cost-benefit analysis of the proposal has been prepared in accordance with the approved method.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I think of nationally significant infrastructure I think of my electorate of Forrest, which is a $15 billion GDP region. It has exponential growth and the need is there for infrastructure to drive further investment and opportunity. The South West of Western Australia is a driver in the state's economic and cultural development. It is also an environmental icon, being listed as one of the world's international biodiversity hotspots. The South West region is the tourism and holiday destination of choice for the majority of people from the Perth metropolitan area. We have a wide range of activities, including agriculture, mining, resources, tourism and construction. These activities, coupled with the significant population growth of the region—it is 2.1 per cent per annum, compared with the state's average of 1.8 per cent and the nation's average of 1.4 per cent—has put significant pressure on the transport infrastructure of the region. It is one of the fastest growing regional areas in Australia, with a current population of 163,000. By 2026, this is expected to increase to at least 230,000. The area holds around 25 per cent of the state's population, the greatest proportion outside the metropolitan area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The South West is frequently underestimated for its economic diversity and stability. It is a key engine room of the state of Western Australia, providing much of the state's energy, industry and manufacturing, which underpins the region's $15 billion economy. It is a mining region that produces $2 billion a year in minerals, a number that will soon grow, with additional exports planned. It is an agricultural region, with a turnover of over $600 million a year in food, mainly in milk, vegetables and beef production. It is also one of the world's premium wine producing regions. So there is a real need for nationally significant infrastructure to manage this growth and future economic development.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Planning for and investment in transport infrastructure has not kept pace with growth or demand in the South West. There has been considerable state and federal investment in roads leading to the South West. These important assets have improved travel between the South West and Perth, but the outcome is that even more traffic is entering the South West, putting even more pressure on local roads.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Time is of the essence here. The completion of the Perth to Bunbury highway was the first step in meeting the road needs of the area. There is now dual lane access from Bunbury north to Perth and beyond. However, this has moved the bottleneck to Bunbury itself. The Bunbury Outer Ring Road has been partially completed, with both state and federal funding. But it is basically now like a T-junction without the ends connected. It needs each end to be completed to link it to the South Western Highway in the north and Bussell Highway in the south. This critical last third needs to be funded and built.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The model that the federal coalition government has put in place for infrastructure funding is a sound one and it is the largest in Australia's history. I am looking forward to the Bunbury Outer Ring Road being prioritised on the Western Australian state government infrastructure agenda, given that federal funding is directly linked to state priorities in the new collaborative model of the Abbott government. The construction of this road is a key need of the region. Once completed, it forms the hub from which a number of important highways radiate out into the South West, servicing the region.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I well understand why capital needs to be spent particularly carefully and why there is a need for a cost-benefit analysis. It is so that projects like this can be assessed in the proper way. I understand the capital needed for projects around Australia to link us to the world. The Business Council of Australia said that we have an infrastructure need of over $760 billion. The coalition government is driving an innovative asset recycling program with incentives to the states and territories to privatise assets and infrastructure. The Minister for Trade and Investment, in his presentation on investment to this House today, advised that he has chaired two meetings of the Commonwealth and state and territory trade and investment ministers. These meetings identified national investment priorities of tourism infrastructure, agribusiness and food, resources and energy, major infrastructure, and advanced manufacturing, services and technology. I note that the minister is appointing five investment specialists to work with Austrade to identify inward investment opportunities and to help make them happen across these five areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is working hand in hand with state and territory governments to attract investment, particularly for major infrastructure. The Minister for Trade and Investment today said that this initiative of the government has sparked interest from international investors such as the $500 billion major pension funds of Canada and the five US investments funds with $l trillion under investment that he met during round table meetings with the fund managers. Investment is one of the four pillars of the coalition government's recently outlined economic diplomacy program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need cost-benefit analysis for us to build sound projects so that we do not end up with the NBN, which was nothing better than a dog's breakfast. It really reinforces the need for this cost-benefit analysis type of approach. I note that even in my part of the world our rail system, particularly in freight transport, has been under pressure. The Collie-Brunswick Junction-Port triangle is the key hub of freight in the region and this has long been recognised as having capacity constraints. Highlighted in the submission by the WA state government to Infrastructure Australia to duplicate the line to that area to increase capacity, this additional expansion will be required on the Collie to Brunswick Junction line, especially with expansion of the Worsley Alumina refinery. The Brunswick Junction to Picton part of the rail line is a principal bottleneck, and this has been one of the priorities for the region. We have got other railway lines such as the Greenbushes to Bunbury railway line as an alternate for freight over time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is one thing I really want to talk about regarding infrastructure and the need for sound planning and processes and why this government's approach is so important. I look at infrastructure such as the regional airport that is needed in the South West based in Busselton. This is the gateway to that wonderful part of the world—the Margaret River and South West regions. We need an airport that is large enough to take direct flights from interstate and overseas so that tourists can get to our region easily and in comfort. The whole region is behind this proposal, which is very important. We know how much the region has to offer and we have a whole lot of small businesses operating throughout the South West engaged in a whole lot of different offerings for tourists and for visitors alike. People need to be able to get there efficiently and safely, and that is why the important process of being able to assess projects and invest in projects that have national significance is so important. I support this bill before the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="99931" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CRAIG KELLY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:11</span>):  I am pleased to rise on the Infrastructure Australia Amendment (Cost Benefit Analysis and Other Measures) Bill 2014. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Infrastructure Australia Act 2008 so that it is a function of Infrastructure Australia to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of those infrastructure projects which are of national significance and which also involve Commonwealth funding of at least $100 million. We know the reason why this bill was required. It is trying to rectify the evil of the absolute debacle we had under the previous Labor government with their so-called NBN and their complete failure to have a cost-benefit analysis of that project, which saw billions of dollars of precious capital wasted. It is not only important that we have a cost-benefit analysis, it is also important that that cost-benefit analysis accounts for all the costs and makes sure it does not overstate or understate the benefits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the remaining time available tonight on this bill I would like to set out a textbook example of a complete failure of a cost-benefit analysis—a cost-benefit analysis full of flawed assumptions that failed to take into account all the costs and completely overstated all the benefits. The cost-benefit analysis I am referring to is that done under the previous Labor government of what is known as the Moorebank intermodal project. We saw from the so-called cost-benefit analysis that was done for this project that it assumed it would have a cost-benefit ratio of 1.72. It sounds pretty impressive until we actually go through all the costs they failed to consider.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first cost they failed to consider was the cost of the land. This land is the existing School of Military Engineering which is between Moorebank Avenue and the Georges River. As part of the Defence annual report of 2012-13, we currently have that land, which is 333½ hectares, valued at just $261.7 million. That is less than $1 million per hectare of land. We have seen small housing lots with houses in our area selling for over $1 million, but here we have the valuation at just $1 million per hectare. And this is highly valuable land. A back-of-the-envelope calculation is that perhaps we need another zero on the end of the valuation of this land. We have land that is a stone's throw from Casula railway station. A footbridge could be put across the Georges River there, and that entire 330-hectare precinct could be accessible by a railway station. There are so many wonderful things that could be done with that parcel of land. And if that land was valued in the cost-benefit analysis at its true value, then the so-called cost-benefit analysis that was done previously simply falls over in a screaming heap.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, what the cost-benefit analysis of the Moorebank Intermodal fails to consider is the cost of all the road and bridge upgrades that are needed, the extra congestion on the local roads, and the commercial effect on the Liverpool CBD. I would like to quickly go through a few of those. The only actual cost of the needed road upgrades that this analysis has added on is a simply four-lane extension to one current section of Moorebank Avenue. That is not in their cost projections until 2029-30. We are talking about moving a million containers a year through this area. The area at the moment is completely congested. People think Port Botany is congested, but all you are doing is moving a problem from Port Botany and dumping that problem out in the Moorebank-Liverpool area. For this intermodal to work, we need billions of dollars worth of upgrades to the local road network.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will go through just a few that are needed. Firstly, we need a new bridge over the M5 motorway across the Georges River. We need another new bridge over Cambridge Avenue at the southern end of the development, also over the Georges River. We need a new bridge on the Hume Highway over Cabramatta Creek. Currently the Hume Highway is six lanes, but the bridge is only four lanes. If we are going to put all this extra traffic in our area, that bridge needs to be upgraded to six lanes. The same goes for the bridge over Prospect Creek. Again, the Hume Highway is six lanes, and the bridge is only four. If this intermodal is going to work and have efficiencies in moving trucks around our local area, that needs to be upgraded. Then we need improved access to the M5. We need a new overpass at Glenfield. A new Liverpool CBD bypass would be required. We would also have to deal with what is either Australia's first or third worst accident hot spot in the entire country. I am talking about the Hume Highway at the back of the Liverpool CBD. Last year we had almost 200 accidents in that short few hundred yards of space, making it one of the worst black spots in our nation's history. Of all the roads we have in our country, this is one of the worst black spots. And the plan is to actually put 270,000 TEU movements through that existing road network. So, if this intermodal has any hope of being economically viable and efficient, we also need that road upgrade. The list of intersections that need upgrading just goes on and on and on. I have a list here of at least 40 different intersections. We are talking about billions of dollars worth of upgrades to local roads that are needed to make this intermodal viable. But not one of those costs is actually in the cost-benefit analysis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we get on to the effect and the reduced access to the Liverpool hospital. The Liverpool hospital is the largest hospital in the Southern Hemisphere. It services all of south-west Sydney, and it is planned that it will grow and grow in the years to come as our population in the south-west continues to increase. The proposal to put in an extra million TEU containers on the local road network and increasing the truck movements through that area will actually reduce access to that hospital. It will mean that someone travelling in the back of an ambulance will have to wait longer in congested traffic to get through the Liverpool CBD. None of that is in the cost-benefit analysis. The other thing that is not in there is the environmental cost, particularly the cost of increasing particulate emissions. This is one of the areas where the cost-benefit analysis that has already been done completely and utterly fails, because it falsely assumes that there are actually some environmental benefits. It considers CO2 emissions without considering the emissions of particulates. There is a big debate about what CO2 emissions do, but the effect this will have will be negligible. However, there will be a real effect on particulate emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason for this mistake is that if we put a container on the back of a train, as compared with moving it by road, then, yes, the rail is more efficient in terms of fuel use. It is actually twice as efficient. So, we need half the amount of diesel fuel. If we are moving a container from Port Botany to Moorebank and if we take it by road, we need twice the amount of diesel fuel. But what the cost-benefit analysis failed to look at is the different levels of particulate emissions from a truck versus those polluting diesel trains. I had the Parliamentary Library do some research for me in this area. For a truck built after 2007—a truck that is getting towards seven or eight years old—compared with the diesel trains we are using, the diesel trains have 20 times more particulate pollution. So, what we will do for every container we take off the road and put on the rail, to move it from Port Botany to Moorebank, is increase the particulate emissions 10-fold. Why is this important? Already in Western Sydney and throughout New South Wales there are over 1,000 deaths a year attributed to particulate-matter air pollution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our monitoring station in Liverpool has continued to show an increase in particulate emissions over the last several years, because of the carbon tax and other issues that have pushed up electricity prices, such as the RET, and with higher electricity prices people have been burning more wood to keep their houses warm in winter. That has raised the particulate matter in Western Sydney—in fact, it has raised it so much that we have had levels in Western Sydney above World Health Organisation standards. The previous government came up with a plan—which, I hate to say, we have at the moment adopted, although hopefully we will see common sense—that will increase the particulate emissions for every container that is moved from Port Botany to Western Sydney 10 times. Of course, that is not included there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we have the case of overstating the benefits. There are warning bells on this project. New South Wales Infrastructure, the state infrastructure strategy said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The short-haul rail market is essentially unproven in Sydney. At present most demand in Sydney is for long-haul export freight and there is significant capacity available at a number of existing intermodal terminals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sydney Ports and Hutchison are currently developing a 300,000 TEU per annum intermodal facility at Enfield. which, it says, was to open in 2013 but has now been pushed back until the end of this year. Enfield proves the test case for larger-scale, short-haul intermodal freight in Sydney. The recommendation from New South Wales Infrastructure is that state public funding for additional intermodal capacity in Sydney be minimised until there is greater clarity on whether the short-haul freight market is viable. That has been completely forgotten in this cost-benefit analysis. It has also failed to consider the competitive exchanges in the market that have occurred. In the last 12 months we know we have had Enfield with a 300,000 capacity which could very easily be stepped up to 400,000 or 500,000. We also had an announcement a few months ago that Asciano would build a 600,000 TEU capacity at Chullora. So we are to have a million TEU capacity coming on line in the next 12 to 18 months. There is simply no demand whatsoever for another million TEU capacity at Moorebank. But none of that has been considered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we have the announcement of Westconnex, which will open up the west of Sydney to the port areas and the airports. The issue is that most of the container freight from port Botany goes out to Western Sydney and particularly to the Eastern Creek area. It defies logic that, when a container arrives at Port Botany, an importer is going to take that container, put it on a train and freight it all the way around to Moorebank, take it off the train at Moorebank, put it on a truck and take it 20 or 25 kilometres up to Eastern Creek. When Westconnex is complete, they will be able to put that container straight on the back of their truck at Port Botany, jump on Westconnex and be up in the Eastern Creek area in half an hour or 40 minutes. So the improvements in infrastructure that this government has announced with Westconnex and the M5 upgrade make the Moorebank project completely redundant.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the solution? I say that if the private sector wants to go ahead with this project, let them; but under the conditions that they pay the true economic cost of that land and that they get no discounts from the Commonwealth. We look at the true value of that land—if it is one or two billion dollars, that is the amount they should pay if they want to use that land. They should also be made to make a contribution to all the road upgrades and all the bridge upgrades that are needed. If they are prepared to do those things, I say let them go ahead. I know that when those costs are truly factored in they will realise this project is a complete white elephant. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:26</span>):  It is nice to have this opportunity tonight to talk about the Infrastructure Australia Amendment (Cost Benefit Analysis and Other Measures) Bill 2014. When I first got elected, I used to think in opposition that it will be great to get to the day when we can return to the Treasury benches and have the cheque book there so I can look out across the electorate of Cowan and say, 'This is what needs to be done, and maybe I can get some federal assistance for that.' Unfortunately, in the intervening period the budget has not been balanced and we are in a position now where the debt is significant. Yet, in spite of those circumstances, the reality now is that the Abbott government has still found $50 billion worth of infrastructure in the years ahead. That is good news, but one of the key things we have learnt from the past six years is the importance of using that money wisely to ensure that the taxpayers' money we are using is well spent and, to the best of our ability, that it is efficient, effective and raises productivity in this country—making peoples' lives better. That is a key responsibility of any government.</span>

The Ocean Reef Road extension, a major project in the middle of Cowan, received $7 million from the Howard government, working with the City of Wanneroo, and was opened in 2010. It was good to see that important infrastructure project completed. In the lead up to the 2007 election there was also the commitment first by us and then by the Labor Party to make Hepburn Avenue a dual carriage way from Mirrabooka Avenue down to Alexander Drive. That was $5 million; and there was another $5 million to work with the City of Swan to extend Hepburn Avenue from Alexander Drive over to Beechboro Road and then Marshall Road. These were important infrastructure projects. Of course, you could not really describe them strictly as federal roads. They were actually local government roads, but in any case it was effective and there were reasons for it. It certainly improved traffic flows through Cowan and is a great link between the major north-south arterials of the Mitchell Freeway and Wanneroo Road and linking over to Alexander Drive and the light industrial area of Malaga adjacent to Ballajura in the electorate of Cowan. There was certainly value in achieving those things, and I was very pleased that they got done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was also very pleased that in the lead up to the last election we promised and in government have committed to providing $615 million for the NorthLinkWA project. NorthLinkWA starts around the intersection of Marshall Road and the Tonkin Highway, just south of Malaga, and continues up to Muchea. It has also been known as the Swan Valley Bypass. It is an important initiative that has been sought after for a long time. I pay tribute to the former member for Pearce, Ms Moylan, and the current member for Pearce, Mr Porter, for the very strong advocacy for the Swan Valley Bypass, which is now known as NorthLinkWA. Swan Valley is of course a significant area of Perth. It is quite a tourist district. Road congestion, with heavy vehicles moving north to mine sites, was a problem that needed to be fixed. I am very pleased that the Abbott government is getting on and doing what needs to be done. It is exactly these sorts of projects that we have to look at in light of this legislation, where a cost benefit analysis can be applied to such projects and across a range of different areas. You can see that there is going to be great value not just in terms of safety but in productivity regarding business traffic and traffic for all people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier, I am very pleased that the Abbott government has found $50 billion for infrastructure investment, because it is important. We are seeing the benefits of this right across the country. The important thing is that when you are entrusted by the people, by the taxpayers, with these sorts of funds there needs to be accountability, openness and transparency. So I am very pleased that the requirements we are putting upon Infrastructure Australia will see exactly these sorts of benefits. It is the case that Infrastructure Australia is already assessing projects which involve Commonwealth funding of over $100 million. It is right that it do so. That is what we said before the election that we would do. I am very happy that it is now happening.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important also that the Commonwealth and Infrastructure Australia work with the state and territory governments. It is an important part of Infrastructure Australia's functions that the national infrastructure audit takes place. The audit starts on 1 September, and a report will be released at the start of next year, as I understand it. Infrastructure Australia is in a position to hear from the stakeholders. I encourage the cities in my area, the cities of Swan, Joondalup and Wanneroo, to make a submission to Infrastructure Australia, which has been tasked by the government to provide transparent advice for priorities for the future over a 15-year period. It will try to make sure that there is a bigger plan than just some short-term political fix, that there is actually an ongoing process that is reviewed and looked at every five years to ensure that the infrastructure that has been thought about and that will get funded actually does provide the cost benefits to the community, and to the business community for employment, that, basically, it makes people's lives a lot better. That is obviously a part of Infrastructure Australia's responsibilities. It is important that future growth is supported by the infrastructure that Infrastructure Australia can recommend to the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, Infrastructure Australia will remain an advisory body. Ultimately, government still needs to be responsible, to be accountable to the people, and cannot just pass off that sort of responsibility. The point I would particularly like to make about the advisory capacity of Infrastructure Australia is that the projects will be assessed and then Infrastructure Australia's assessment will be loaded onto a website and can be looked at. There will be complete transparency, which is the way it should be done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Infrastructure Australia's key priorities are to assess projects that are receiving government funding of $100 million or more, undertake an audit of nationally significant infrastructure and develop the 15-year plan on infrastructure priorities. It will be restructured to have a chairman, with a CEO and of course a board with whom the chairman will work. These are important things. They are important parts of our transparency. We know as well that it will not be just a matter of the $50 billion provided by the federal government. It is right that the Treasury has informed us that it anticipates that a further $125 billion in new infrastructure investment will also be achieved by the Commonwealth being able to contribute in this area through the work of Infrastructure Australia as an advisory body. It is a good future, it is a transparent future, it is going to be an effective way forward. This is exactly what needs to take place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to seeing some projects from the Cowan electorate of Western Australia get up. Something I would like to see done in the Cowan electorate is a great deal more work on the main road, Wanneroo Road. Wanneroo Road is pretty much a dual carriageway—two lanes each way—but it carries a lot of traffic and a lot of traffic with a lot of load. While there are some parts of Wanneroo Road that could be extended or which could have a third lane added, the reality is that many parts of it could not support a third lane, because the houses are too close to the side of the road. It would be good to see overpasses above Wanneroo Road to try to improve traffic flow—at Joondalup Drive and Wanneroo Road and at Hepburn Avenue and Wanneroo Road. These would be good projects. I can see that there is enough room in these places to support that sort of infrastructure and there would be benefits for business and commuter traffic. Better traffic flows are better for the environment, as well as giving people the opportunity to get where they need to go a little bit quicker. Getting home quicker in the evening also yields a good social bonus, you might say.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to see an overpass on the Reid Highway going over Malaga Drive. That is a very congested intersection with very significant amounts of industrial traffic. That would be nice to see. I know the state government has it on their list to get done, but it would be good to try to move that along a little bit quicker with some federal money. Again, I know that there is a shortage of federal money at the moment, but, if the case can be made by the City of Swan in that case, or by the City of Wanneroo or the City of Wanneroo on the other matters relating to Wanneroo Road, there are some great opportunities there. If the case can be made to Infrastructure Australia about the value that could be achieved in the outer northern suburbs of Perth, it would be good to see such projects get up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are other projects as well. More needs to be done with Gnangara Road—and again I know the Barnett state government has some plans there and some money to get that project going. Gnangara Road is very much in need of a dual carriageway. There are many other intersections and other areas of road in Cowan and its immediate surrounds that could use work. Another important overpass to get done is at the intersection of the Reid Highway and the Mitchell Freeway. That is another choke point which is a problem for both commuters and some business traffic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can look at my electorate and say that there are many projects that would be good—but they need to be properly assessed. The cost-benefit analysis needs to be done to make sure that the money would be well spent. I know that. I am not trying to get any special favours for the electorate of Cowan, but I am determined to help make the case—to demonstrate to Infrastructure Australia just how good some of those projects I have mentioned would be. Before I conclude, I would like to thank the Assistant Minister for Infrastructure, the Hon. Jamie Briggs, for the support he has provided to get the $300,000 set of lights to fix up the black spot on the corner of Alexander Drive and Illawarra Crescent North, adjacent to Ballajura. It is a very important intersection—people have lost their lives there—and fixing it up is a great federal government project.</span>

If anyone accuses the coalition government of not having a sense of humour, I will be there to say otherwise. You have been in power for just over a year but you are only getting this bill, the Infrastructure Australia Amendment (Cost Benefit Analysis and Other Measures) Bill 2014, to parliament now. In the course of that year, how much money have you thrown at projects? And you thought that now was the time to do cost-benefit analysis on infrastructure?</span>

                    </a>  The thing is, Member for Hughes, you guys made this a big deal. This was your priority. 'We have to do cost-benefit analysis before any project that we do.' That is what you used to say. But then you spent the first 12 months throwing buckets of cash at projects—and you did not do a cost-benefit analysis until when? It is now nearly October and only now is this bill before the chamber. It is a farce. Look at all the projects that you did! </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the NBN, you criticised us for not doing a cost-benefit analysis, but then you went and defamed the NBN project. You put together a bunch of people to do your so-called 'cost-benefit analysis'. Among them you included Henry Ergas, a noted critic of the project—and he has been for ages. It is his right to be a critic, but it is not the right of the government to put someone in who has a fixed view, who will deliver a predetermined outcome from what was supposed to be an objective cost-benefit analysis. Off the top of your head, Member for Melbourne Ports, what conclusion do you think Henry Ergas arrived at after his cost-benefit analysis? Do you reckon he thought the NBN was good value for money?</span>

You got a whole bunch of noted critics together, including Kevin Morgan—I have to say that I have a lot of time for Kevin, having known him through the union movement, but he has never been a fan of the NBN—then you get them to do this so-called 'cost-benefit analysis'. Tell me, though: where was your cost-benefit analysis when you chucked $1.5 billion at WestConnex? You just wrote it off.</span>

I do oppose a project like WestConnex that does not go fully into the city, does not connect fully to the airport and re-tolls sections of the M4 that have already been paid for. Apparently, the member for Hughes thinks it is a great idea that his constituents should pay again for travelling on sections of that roadway when they have already paid it off. He thinks that is a great idea. The thing is that his constituents, knowing his part of Sydney, do not go through the M4.

                    </a>  I have already been critical of this project before. I have no problem criticising this project, because it does not do what it is supposed to do. There are already concerns about the management of that process, there are already concerns about the travel forecast and there are  already concerns about the secrecy that is entailed around this project. The fact of the matter is that the coalition put $1.5 billion with no strings. The coalition did not say that it should definitely go into the city and they did not say that it should definitely go to the airport. The coalition is happy to impose tolls on a roadway that has already been paid for. That is scandalous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But guess what? There was no cost-benefit analysis when they chucked $1.5 billion at that project. There was none whatsoever. There was the dodgy cost-benefit analysis that was done nearly a year after the coalition had been in office on the NBN, but there is no cost-benefit analysis on some of these other big infrastructure projects. We are expected to just basically pat the coalition on the back for finally getting around to doing something that they said was a big deal, after one year of being in office and billions being spent on infrastructure in the way that it is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard the member for Banks earlier give his fractured fairy tale account of how the NBN went. A person who came from a sector that depends on good infrastructure in terms of broadband and communications and someone who has been involved in the digital economy bagging out the NBN is simply bizarre; but the fact of the matter is that he was wrong. The fact of the matter is that when the coalition was in government last time, they tried nearly 20 times to get broadband sorted out in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The big sticking block for the coalition was that they could never get past Telstra. Telstra commanded the telecommunications industry. Basically, if it did not agree to something, nothing happened in terms of broadband. Go and ask Helen Coonan what type of blues she had with them. When Telstra did put forward plans on what they would do on broadband, they wanted to have a rate of return that the ACCC went pink on the face on and that the ACCC did not allow to happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we got into government and we put forward the proposition that we wanted to upgrade broadband in this country through the National Broadband Network, we put aside a shade under $5 billion and we asked everyone to tender for it. The biggest telecommunications company and the sole tenderer at that time put in five pages for a $5 billion project. They put in five pages as a tender for a $5 billion project. Those five pages were not about a question of quantity over quality. Tender projects should not just be about reams of paper. What it said clearly was that they were not willing to play and that they would do what they always did in Telstra's case, which is to be litigious, take you through courts and make you get to plan 20—after the coalition had tried 19 times before—of trying to improve broadband in this country. It failed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we took the view that we would undertake landmark reform in telecommunications, we would basically do the job through a GBE that would be set up and we would ensure structural separation with Telstra. We went through that project. That was based on the public wanted, which was better broadband. What the coalition wanted to do was go through a cost-benefit analysis. That was not for the sake of going for a cost-benefit analysis to improve the project, but to delay the project.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I had constituent forums in my electorate, I would have Liberal plants in the audience say, 'You should go through a cost-benefit analysis.' I said, 'You know what, I will not go to the politics of it. I will just ask the crowd.' These were people who had been struggling with pair-gain systems, faulty broadband networks in their area and ADSL that was not delivering to them. They were basically frustrated to their back teeth with poor infrastructure. When I asked them what they wanted, I would say to them, 'Do you want a cost-benefit analysis or do you want us to get the job done?' They unanimously said that they wanted better broadband. They do not need a cost-benefit analysis, because they have been waiting for so long and the coalition has failed to deliver. That is exactly what is happening under the coalition's regime now, where the rate of connections is dropping and the speed at which the coalition is rolling out the network is dropping. But they have got their cost-benefit analysis, so kudos there! The coalition has got their bit of paper. But the things that are required by the general public are not delivered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us go to another big project that is going on right now. In January 2013, when the coalition was quizzed about it, they said they had no plans for a second airport at Badgerys Creek. That is what the coalition said. By the end of the year, the coalition was basically gearing up to make an announcement to build a second airport in Sydney. Where was the cost-benefit analysis on that? Billions of dollars were committed to that project. The coalition has already started the roadworks on that project as well. There is no cost-benefit analysis—none whatsoever—on a project that will have billions of dollars put to it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has all sorts of figures about what it is going to do. They have dangled the whole jobs thing in front of people and suggested that it would be a big jobs creator, creating 5,000 jobs. We got that figure from a briefing that was convened by the Deputy Prime Minister, who then deigned not to turn up to the briefing and explain to Western Sydney MPs what would happen. That is 5,000 jobs in a region where there are nearly two million people. That is roughly one job for every 400 people in Western Sydney.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition is going to commit all of this money to roadworks and all this money to the airport itself, but they have not put in a cost-benefit analysis on it whatsoever. We have seen enough examples of that in the international space and even here in Australia. Go to Avalon and see the glory that is supposed to be a second airport operating in one metropolitan area and you can see what is happening there. Go to Canada and see what has happened over in Montreal, where they have had a second airport there that is on its last legs as well. We are now committing to a similar sort of thing in building a second airport in one metropolitan area where there are concerns about its future financial viability.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The job figures are not fair dinkum. They are providing a figure of 60,000 jobs—which, by the way, is double the amount of jobs that are provided by Sydney Airport—for a configuration that is one runway and will only really provide 5,000 jobs. There is no cost-benefit analysis. On top of that, a 24-hour-a-day airport is going to be plonked right in the middle of one of the fastest-growing regions in the country, with two million people, and there is no environmental impact statement for that airport at all.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The thing that gets me is the fact that, due to the decisions of this mob opposite, the electorate that I represent is going to lose $270 million in schools funding over 10 years, and the university that is in our region will face up to 40 per cent in funding cuts, which will force people in the region that I live in to pay higher university fees to make up for those cuts, yet I cannot get things like an MRI for my local hospital. Those opposite will not fund that, and they cut funding to state governments for health care. They cut billions—$80 billion in combined cuts to health and education—they pushed through the changes on higher education, they force through cuts to family payments, they force people to pay to see a doctor, yet all the things that we need in our area are not delivered to the people that need those things the most. They do not get the service and infrastructure that they need, but they get an airport. They get a 24-hour-a-day airport with no cost-benefit analysis and no EIS. They are forced to have it because eastern suburbs interests want to have this airport plonked in Western Sydney. Those opposite do not give us the infrastructure that we want or the services that we want and need. Instead, they give us what they think we need, which has been the case for development in Western Sydney for quite some time.</span>

Those opposite have worked hard to cripple Infrastructure Australia's independence in its decision-making processes, and then we get this legislation as an afterthought. It is almost as though someone tapped the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Infrastructure on the shoulder and reminded them that there is one outstanding thing stuck on the Post-it note that needs to be dealt with, so they cobbled this together and put it into parliament. It is an absolute farce in terms of what it does. It is not right for the nation. </span>

We should be able to find ways to make public transport work better. In my part of the world, people want to be able to catch a bus or a train to get to work. I am not Robinson Crusoe in this, and I am certain that there will be other members in the chamber who often have constituents come up to them and say, 'I would love to catch public transport; where do I park my car?' and point to a street with no facilities that is already jam-packed. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There should be clever thinking and there should be collaboration between federal, state and local governments to ensure that we provide facilities that better utilise public transport. I wonder if the federal government is doing anything on this issue. I wonder if the Abbott government has actually thought, 'How do we utilise existing infrastructure better by investing in other assets that allow people to use that infrastructure better?' The Abbott government has cut pretty much all spending to public transport infrastructure. There is nothing available at all to better use—</span>

In the 2014-15 budget, the coalition government laid out a historic $50 billion for the Infrastructure Investment Program to deliver vital transport infrastructure across our cities, regional centres and rural communities. I commend the coalition's policy to (1) target investment in productive infrastructure, (2) complete projects faster, (3) partner with state governments, and (4) leverage more private sector investment.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to recognise that our infrastructure needs cannot be met by a single government or indeed by a single tier of government. Collaborating across all tiers of government is essential. Significant progress has been made in these areas; however, witnesses who appeared before the committee believe that there is still more to be done. It is important to recognise that improved planning can provide significant material benefits to governments, to the economy and, particularly, to the communities that are served by the infrastructure—including by providing some certainty for the private sector for their planning purposes and to make investment decisions, by providing opportunities to minimise the lifetime costs of projects, by providing maximum flexibility for the programming and scheduling of outlays, by minimising integrated transport and land use options and making urban development more competitive, and, importantly, by providing needed infrastructure on which the community relies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Conventionally, state and territory governments have lead responsibility for infrastructure and land use planning, and they are supported in this role by local governments. However, witnesses have said that they see the federal government as having a particular interest and responsibility where these activities intersect with national interest. Australia's future productivity growth will depend to a large degree on our capacity to improve existing infrastructure and to develop new infrastructure which creates an integrated transport network across Australia. The committee recognises that this is an increasingly competitive task. Commonwealth, state, and territory interests intersect in a number of areas, such as inland freight rail, airports and ports. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249224" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms RYAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lalor</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:00</span>):  I rise this evening to speak on a variety of matters in the education and early childhood area. As you may be aware, my electorate of Lalor has over 10,000 families that access early childhood support and out-of-school-hours services. Most of my electorate would be classified as urban growth; however, I also represent small pockets of quite isolated rural areas. One such area is Little River. The population of Little River is around 750 people. It is served by a combined shop and service station, which, like in many small communities, doubles as a post office. It has a hotel, a kindergarten and a small primary school. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The primary school is aptly named the Little River Primary School. It currently has 114 students from 77 families. It is ably led by Principal Pamela Heane and School Council President Gillian Caldwell. It has only in recent years been rebuilt by the state Labor government. It is a school that is providing a great education and it is a focus of the local community. Two weeks ago the school contacted me, shocked to discover that, due to a change in classification, it is now regarded as an urban city school.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This school has out-of-school-hours care that operates from seven to 8.45 am and from 3.30 to 6.30 pm Monday to Friday. Fifty-seven students from 39 families access before-school or after-school care out of the 77 families that use the school. Imagine their dismay in discovering this reclassification means the service will lose $16,000 in funding, basically making it unviable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ramifications for these families are very real. There are no public buses in Little River. The children who use this service would be left to walk home to an empty home in a town that has no footpaths. On one side of Little River children would need to cross a bridge with no room for pedestrians—only just enough room for passing cars. On the other side of the town they would need to cross an unmanned railway line. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the school were to lose their out-of-school-hours care program, they would be likely to lose approximately a third of their families. To lose this program would be crippling for Little River Primary School and for the Little River community. The reality is that if parents in this community cannot access out-of-school-hours care, they may be forced to change schools, to have their children attend a school closer to where they work, out of their local area. This could leave the school less viable and the downward cycle of local service access would begin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not a service at the edges. There is no alternative for these families. There is no neighbouring school to combine with. There is no private provider. This is a vital service that has been supported to date by the Commonwealth government. This seems a short-sighted decision. I call on the government to reverse it for Little River Primary School and for other schools similarly affected.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to speak on other matters around education and early childhood. I mention the impact of the cuts to kindergarten funding, dropping the guaranteed 15 hours of kindergarten and the huge effect this will have on our community. The minister may think this has gone away because of the promised announcement for 2015, but she is very wrong if she believes that. In my community, with high numbers of low-SES households and high numbers of families from non-English-speaking backgrounds, approximately only 80 per cent of children are enrolled in kindergarten. With a potential increase in fees, the number of children not attending kindergarten would only grow. Those children who would benefit the most would be the most likely to not access the important early education programs they need. The minister needs to know that this will not go away in our community, that the community are campaigning and will continue to campaign until that 15 hours is guaranteed beyond 2015. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, my community has the highest number of registered family day care services in Australia. There are 44 services in Lalor that are set to lose funding due to the cuts to family day care funding. I would implore the minister to relook at these two issues and to think of the people of Lalor while she does. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BROUGH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:05</span>):  Whilst travelling up to Flaxton the other day to visit the Blackall Range Care Group AGM, I had a bit of time to spare so I dropped into a local school right on the boundary of Fisher and Fairfax. It is a country school called Chevallum State School. Given the comments of the member for Lalor a moment ago, it is somewhat reflective. Chevallum is a little school with 500 students. The moment you walk in you sense the affection and the passion that everyone has for the school. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here is the interesting part—of the 500 students, only 50 are from the direct catchment. The other 450 students travel some considerable distance, as far as Caboolture in the south and Noosa in the north, which, for those who are familiar with the territory, is a long way. When you learn these things, you have to ask, 'Why?' Having spoken to and spent a few minutes with the principal, it became very clear that here was a school with great passion and great principles and that is based on there being a very supportive community. I digress and say that, now that I am a grandparent, but not of school-age children, whenever a parent says to me, 'How do I know whether a school is any good?' I say, 'Go and spend five minutes with the principal; you will know straightaway what is important to them.' I can tell you that the Chevallum State School meets that test.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having briefly turned up there, I was delighted to meet Ben, the president of the P&amp;C Association. They were having a wrap-up from the strawberry fest that they had had on the Friday night, so it was a great opportunity to catch up with a bunch of parents and talk about some of the issues. They have some pretty big issues, and I want to canvass one of those here tonight. The other issue, briefly, is one of safety, and I hope that the Black Spot Program the Commonwealth government runs is going to be able to help slow the traffic and help protect the children in this country town.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The particular issue they wanted to raise with me, since I had dropped in, goes back to 2007 and the Howard years when we introduced the school chaplaincy program. I do not think there would be a person in this House who would not have heard a story from the schools in their electorate about the positive impact this program has had both in the school community as a whole and on individual lives. This particular school has chosen very deliberately, because of the inclusive nature of its students, to engage a welfare officer as opposed to a religious based chaplain. They said, 'It was a purposeful act to ensure that we met inclusive values. Our community feels there is a risk that a religious based person may inadvertently exclude some of the community members.' I respect that right. We talked about it for a while. When going to the last election, the Abbott government committed to funding the chaplaincy program through the next four years. But, sadly, that will mean that these people, who are skilled welfare workers and youth workers, will not be engaged in this program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to bring to the House's attention two examples of the changes that this welfare officer has made to the life of individuals and hence to the community of Chevallum. She talked about a female student who was referred to a youth work program via the guidance officer and who was presenting with emergent adolescent risk taking, concerns of self-harm and experiencing a breakdown in family relationship functioning. This was resulting in the student frequently absconding from home. The youth worker, working alongside existing support services within the school, was able to provide a level of support that not only re-engaged the student with her family and resulted in her returning home but has meant that she has now successfully made the transition to high school which can be so challenging for many.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second example was a male student who moved to the school 18 months ago. He had experienced significant difficulties in a previous school with self-harming behaviour—absconding, risk taking and violence—and we all know where that can lead to. But again, through the work of the youth worker, they prioritised the development of a mutual respect relationship with the student which would underpin the potential successes in his ability to self-manage the manifestations of his emotional state. These are just two examples of something which many, many people would be aware of in this House. There was a positive outcome here again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ben Calder, the president of the school, is asking the government—and I ask on his behalf—that the minister and the executive think again about how we may be able to accommodate these fine people who are doing good work and meeting the needs of these schools. Clearly, when people travel so far—nearly nine out of 10 of those students are travelling that distance—they really do have something special to offer.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:10</span>):  I would like to bring the attention of the House to the North Melbourne Primary School, located in my electorate of Melbourne. I was recently sent a number of letters by year 3 students at this school. I would like to read some of those letters to the House. Nine-year-old Ryan wrote: 'I am writing to you because of how worried I am about my school. Next year there are more children entering our school. We already have 610 kids in our school. We have already lost a quarter of our library. Can you please help us by putting demountables into our school?' Gina, who is eight years old, wrote: 'This year our school is crowded, but next year it is going to be even bigger. We are thinking of getting demountables, otherwise we will lose some of our specialist rooms. We have already lost some of our library and we do not want to lose more!' Mahdi wrote: 'It is getting really full in North Melbourne Primary School.' Sidney wrote: 'Next year our school will be stuffed with students. I would like to ask you if we could have a few demountables so we will not be so jammed.' Andy, an eight-year-old, wrote: 'I am really worried about the art room being a classroom, because I love doing art.' Olive wrote: 'We will learn better in classrooms, not the library.' Emily, Axel, Liban, James and Harrison also wrote to me to tell me that North Melbourne Primary School is crowded and needs new demountables.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over 600 students are currently enrolled in North Melbourne Primary School, with numbers set to rise. The department of education is projecting almost a doubling in the number of children seeking to enrol in the school in coming years. This year there were over 40 additional enrolments from the school zone. To make space for classes, teachers have given up a staff room. The new flexible learning space and up to two-thirds of the library are also being used to give classes and, as a result, cannot be used for the purposes they were built for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many primary schools in my electorate and across the inner city are experiencing high demand for places. This is also the case for secondary school education, with schools such as University High in my electorate under pressure from large numbers of applications from families living within their school zones. In some zones it has become increasingly hard to ensure that brothers and sisters can attend the same school. I have heard from parents who have been forced to move to a new home a few blocks away to keep their kids at the same school.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate of Melbourne is diverse. There are more people living in public housing in Melbourne than in any other electorate in the country, and many people have a migrant or refugee background. Meanwhile, in places like Docklands and North Melbourne, more and more young families are moving into apartments or new housing developments. The provision of vital public infrastructure and community assets such as schools, libraries and open spaces must keep pace with development in the inner part of Melbourne.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been out talking to the community with Ellen Sandell, the Greens candidate for Melbourne in the coming Victorian election, which includes North Melbourne Primary School. Parents tell Ellen all the time how important their kids' education is and that they are concerned when pressure is placed on school infrastructure. This problem needs a fair and sustainable solution. We must put more money into public education. We want to be part of finding that sustainable solution to ensure that our schools have the right resources.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">North Melbourne Primary School is a very successful school, with outstanding teachers and staff who are providing a great education to local children. We need to make sure that North Melbourne, and all schools, get the support and infrastructure that they need. Today I say 'thank you' to the students of the year 3 class at North Melbourne Primary School and their teacher. I am very glad that they are concerned enough about their school to raise this important issue. The Greens are committed to public education to ensure the future of children like those who wrote me these letters.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="E07" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs MARKUS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:14</span>):  I rise today to speak on the first anniversary of the Blue Mountains bushfires in October last year. Earlier this week I was able to talk, ever so briefly, about the funding from the federal government and the state government that is supporting local community organisations and local councils in building resilience and also assisting with preparation for the upcoming and future bushfire seasons. On 17 October 2013, the Linksview Road fire burnt indiscriminately through the communities of Springwood, Winmalee and Yellow Rock, causing devastation and heartbreak. The State Mine fire devoured 50,000 hectares, affecting the communities of Mount Wilson and Mount Irvine. It impacted on the Hawkesbury area significantly, requiring evacuations and road closures. The Mount York Road fire burnt more than 8,000 hectares of bushland, destroying homes in Mount Victoria. These three fires, spread across the electorate of Macquarie, were significant and required the deployment of many volunteers and emergency service personnel. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The impact of these bushfires was significant, with 208 homes lost and another 191 damaged. I, like everyone else, am deeply grateful that no lives were lost and, while the road to recovery has been hard and challenging, today I see survivors and overcomers—a community that has pulled together to become stronger and more resilient. There were so many to thank for their bravery and courage that day and in the many days and weeks that have followed. A special mention must go to the Springwood Sports Club, the Richmond Club and the Penrith Panthers Leagues Club.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The work of emergency services should be recognised—the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, National Parks, RAAF bases Richmond and Glenbrook, the New South Wales Fire and Rescue, the SES and the New South Wales Police. I thank also Habitat for Humanity, the neighbourhood centres and the Blue Mountains City Council. There were many more that I do not have time to name. I also thank the Prime Minister, Minister Payne and Minister Keenan, who were with me on the ground within days of the disaster, acting swiftly to activate relief. I also mention the New South Wales government, who partnered with the government in aid and recovery, which is ongoing. There are many who have worked tirelessly to rebuild their community and support those that were and continue to be impacted by the devastation. They have been noticed and their efforts have not been in vain. With that, I give a special thanks to Morna Colbran, from Winmalee Neighbourhood Centre. She has worked tirelessly over many long hours, on many weekends, with her family coming alongside her to assist her as well, to ensure that the community have every need that she sees met.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The journey has been long for those who have lost their homes—it is a journey of unforseen challenges and I acknowledge their hardships and toil. I acknowledge Susan Templeman, who also lost her family home. Many decided to leave the mountains and not to rebuild. This was sad and challenging for our community. Many faced challenges with insurance issues and the changes to building codes and requirements for new homes built in fire-affected areas. These issues continue to be addressed today and I am pleased that through the joint federal and state Flexible Community Grants Program, the Elizabeth Evatt Community Legal Centre will receive funding to conduct seminars that will provide expert advice particularly in the area of insurance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we see homes being rebuilt and the surrounding environment bursting with bouts of new green life. The tourists are returning and recently the Blue Mountains City Council advised that 110 development applications had been received, and the council has been working hard to see these come to fruition. I recently visited Joe Mercieca, owner of Blue Eco Homes, whose business was destroyed during the fires. His business, now rebuilt, demonstrates the passion of this community and his family's passion for rebuilding. They are determined to remain unbeaten and to overcome adversity. I also want to acknowledge the great work of the Blue Mountains Economic Enterprise, who showed initiative with the (re) Build Expo. They too will receive funding to assist in continuing this great work. Disasters and the days that follow are not the time to play politics. This is a time to acknowledge the commitment and determination of a community to overcome adversity. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GILES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:19</span>):  Last Friday, I visited Bubup Wilam for Early Learning Aboriginal Child and Family Centre in Thomastown with Richard Wynne MP, Victorian shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs and Closing the Gap and Jenny Mikakos MLC, Victorian shadow minister for community services, shadow minister for children and shadow minister for seniors and ageing. This followed a visit in the previous week by the Leader of the Opposition and Senator Nova Peris. Since my election I have enjoyed a close association with the centre, following on from my predecessor, Harry Jenkins. I have developed a deep appreciation of its powerful impact. Bubup Wilam was opened in February 2012. It is the first and, for now, only Aboriginal child and family centre in Melbourne and one of only two in Victoria . It was established by the previous Labor government as part of the Closing the Gap COAG agenda. I am pleased to say that every level of government contributed something to the project, with the federal government contributing $8.2 million, the former state Labor government contributing half a million dollars, and the City of Whittlesea providing the land itself. I am very pleased that there is now strong and established community support for the centre, which is at capacity and achieving great results.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the parents, Jamie Williamson of Wollert, has his 11-month old daughter at Bubup Wilam four days a week. Jamie and his partner cherish the role the centre plays in providing a place for cultural learning that their daughter would not otherwise receive at a mainstream childcare centre. They worry about what would happen should Bubup Wilam no longer be able to provide these learnings. They, like many Australians, took at face value the Prime Minister's claim that he would be a 'Prime Minister for Indigenous Affairs'. I thought that the Prime Minister's impressive Closing the Gap speech accorded with this, and I applauded his new commitment then to increase the rate of school attendance for Indigenous children. However, it is difficult to reconcile the Prime Minister's commitment with these, effectively, cuts to Aboriginal child and family centres.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Federal and state Labor and council have invested in Bubup Wilam because they understand that there is more to Closing the Gap than just giving speeches. Regrettably, the coalition has refused to commit any specific funding for the ongoing operation of these centres. The minister complains that Labor did not commit additional funding over the forward estimates. Is the minister really suggesting that if Labor had committed funding for additional years this funding would have remained off limits? Given the minister's claim that funding the centre's operations are not the Commonwealth's responsibility and the sweeping cuts and broken promises made in the budget, including to Indigenous affairs, I very much doubt it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a positive note, however, I am pleased to advise that the local council, the City of Whittlesea, continues to support the ongoing operations of Bubup Wilam. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the present Victorian government. It is worth noting that Wendy Lovell, the Minister for Housing and Minister for Children and Early Childhood Development, has been invited to Bubup Wilam but has not attended. I am glad that Richard Wynne and Jenny Mikakos know the value of the centre and that they made the time to visit and to constructively engage and understand the important work that is being done there. It is a positive sign for this community, where there have been few of late. I think there is cause for optimism with the people of Victoria having an opportunity to set things right in the Victorian context on 29 November. I hope that they do. I can only think of the tragic waste of resources and good will should two coalition governments continue on their current path of abandonment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday, during question time, the Prime Minister was given an opportunity by the Leader of the Opposition to take a practical step to close the gap and fund this and the other 37 centres. Unfortunately, he declined to do so. Labor has a proven track record in taking practical measures to close the gap. I like to think that we have set a good example for this government to follow and that bipartisanship can characterise our engagement in this vital national endeavour. But, in the meantime, I will continue to fight for the future of Bubup Wilam and the community it serves, because it must be allowed to continue its good work. I call on the Prime Minister to reconsider his response yesterday and to continue to support the 70 Aboriginal children in Melbourne's north to get the start in life that they deserve. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr MATHESON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:23</span>):  I recently had the great pleasure of attending the book launch of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ministering Angels</span>—a book about the Camden District Red Cross between 1914 and 1945. <span style="font-style:italic;">Ministering Angels</span> is written by Dr Ian Willis of the University of Wollongong and conveys the extraordinary story of conservative Camden women, who, within the confines of rural life, carried out patriotic duties during the war.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following the outbreak of World War I in 1914, an inspiring, wealthy and powerful group of Camden Edwardian women formed the Camden District Red Cross branch—the first branch in New south Wales outside of Sydney. Dr Willis's book reveals that these women of the Red Cross were portrayed as mothers and guardian angels to wounded soldiers on the battlefield. As such, Camden district volunteers were encouraged to immerse themselves in this ministering angel mythology by assisting 'their boys' serving in overseas battlefields in every possible way they could.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After reading Dr Willis's book, there is no doubt in my mind that Camden was full of devoted guardian angels. Women of the Camden District Red Cross worked selflessly and wholeheartedly from the day the branch was established on August 14, 1914. During this time, their key objective was to produce goods that would help 'their boys' serving overseas and more generally the 'old country' in their war efforts. Sewing, knitting and cooking volunteer activities were   interspersed with fundraising stalls and raffles. In the Camden branches first year, its dedicated volunteers managed to send 4,000 garments overseas and raised 2,145 pounds from individual and community donations—a huge total for those days when three pence was regarded as a worth donation. This achievement was an indication of the Camden district's women's hard work and sheer determination to make a valuable contribution to their country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Willis's powerful narration also makes an important contribution in highlighting how the Red Cross empowered Camden women to engage in patriotic endeavours at a time of national emergency and changed the landscape and history of volunteerism in the Camden district. The story that Dr Willis conveys in <span style="font-style:italic;">Ministering</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Angels</span> shines a light on the outstanding leadership roles that Camden's Edwardian women played in the Red Cross, particularly its founders Sibella and Enid Macarthur Onslow. Their leadership roles in establishing and directing the Red Cross created groundbreaking opportunities that empowered women to make meaningful contributions in supporting Australian soldiers at war, as well as the broader community during peacetime. Whilst local studies and publications such as Dr Willis's are few and far between, <span style="font-style:italic;">Ministering Angels</span> is a timely reminder that it is possible for us all to make a meaningful contribution to a cause bigger than ourselves, no matter who we are or where we are from.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The recent publication and launch of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ministering Angels</span> is a fitting way to commemorate the Camden Red Cross Branch's 100 years of service this year. The Red Cross was, and still is, a significant international voluntary organisation. It continues to practice charitable ideals and to organise a host of social, cultural and political activities. It is clear from reading <span style="font-style:italic;">Ministering Angels</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>that the Camden Red's Cross 100 years of service has established an important legacy of women's voluntary activism in Camden. This legacy is so deeply entrenched within the Camden community that the district branch continues to thrive today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to recognise that Camden is still blessed with many wonderful ministering angels who dedicate their time to the Red Cross cause. Camden identity, Joyce Thorn, is described by Dr Willis in the book as a person that continues to perpetuate the ministering angel mythology. Ms Thorn joined the Red Cross in 1973 and was president of the Camden branch in 1993. As a spritely 91-year-old and after 40 years in the organisation, Ms Thorn still engages in Red Cross fundraising activities. I was pleased to learn that Ms Thorn's strong commitment to serving the community was recognised in 2005, when she was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Penny Love is another Red Cross volunteer who fits the ministering angel mythology. Ms Love balanced her teaching responsibilities with organising the junior Red Cross society at Camden Central for over 25 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to commend the author of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ministering Angels</span>, Dr Ian Willis, for documenting the experiences of the women who devoted their lives to the Red Cross cause with missionary zeal. It is an important part of Australia's history—a part that should never be forgotten. I would also like to recognise John and Julie Wrigley of the Camden Historical Society and Camden Museum for the contribution they have made to the publication and launch of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ministering Angels</span>.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was delighted to attend the book launch in September, and I congratulate the Camden Red Cross current coordinator, Mrs Judy Wilson, on its success. Mrs Wrigley must also be commended for her role in curating a fantastic new exhibition at Camden Museum that tells the story of the Camden District Red Cross in War and Peace. The colourful exhibition includes many photos, a spinning wheel from World War I and Red Cross recruitment posters from World War II. Dr Willis, Mrs Judy Wilson and Mr John and Mrs Julie Wrigley have all made a fantastic contribution in bringing this important part of Macarthur's' history into being and for aptly capturing the generous spirit of the Camden Red Cross Society that is still well and truly alive today. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>
